00:00:00.160 All right, we are live guys. I am aware
00:00:03.280 there are some technical issues. Uh
00:00:05.040 unfortunately, you can run as many tests
00:00:06.879 as you want, but of course uh when the
00:00:10.639 time comes uh that's when there's uh
00:00:12.480 issues. So uh we are monitoring it. Do
00:00:15.120 not worry. Uh we will try our absolute
00:00:17.279 best. Um we do know that there are some
00:00:19.199 frame rate issues at the moment. Uh for
00:00:21.279 those that are thought that I was doing
00:00:23.519 an AI video, no, that was simply just
00:00:25.119 the trailer. if you guys saw the trailer
00:00:26.560 that we rolled um a few days before
00:00:30.240 uh we went live. Um
00:00:33.120 and yeah, with that being said, guys,
00:00:34.559 let me know, give me out of a 10, how
00:00:36.000 are you guys feeling? Uh let me know in
00:00:37.440 the chat. Um I am a 10 out of 10. I'm
00:00:40.800 hoping that uh we can get uh some of
00:00:42.559 these uh frame rate issues sorted. Uh
00:00:45.440 and then uh sound is clear. That is good
00:00:48.480 to see. Uh good to see. Good to see. Uh
00:00:53.039 let's see. 6 10 10 10 10
00:00:58.800 Let's see. Let me bring this a little
00:01:00.000 closer. Uh 10 feeling actually 10 10 two
00:01:05.199 two Well, I'm sorry to hear that. Mix
00:01:07.680 alakio.
00:01:09.600 Uh sorry to hear that. Uh guys, just let
00:01:11.760 me know in terms of audio. Are we good
00:01:13.840 to go? I know that there's some frame
00:01:15.040 rate issues at the moment. So, as I
00:01:16.560 said, hopefully once we pull up the
00:01:18.720 presentation, it shouldn't be too much
00:01:19.840 of an issue. Um audio good. Let me know
00:01:22.880 on the visuals. I'm assuming it's a
00:01:24.960 little bit of a glitch, but as I said,
00:01:26.000 we'll we'll try to troubleshoot it as
00:01:27.680 time goes on. Uh audio good. Good audio.
00:01:32.560 Yes. Uh all good. Sound is clear. 1010.
00:01:36.720 Yes. Audio is good.
00:01:39.520 Audio is good. Quality is glitching. Uh
00:01:42.079 video not so good. Uh video slow slight
00:01:45.280 delay. Okay, cool. Yeah. Well, guys, I
00:01:46.720 said I I'll keep a an eye out on it. Uh
00:01:49.360 frame rate drop. Dory. Uh True.
00:01:53.439 Audio is good. Video is not fine. So,
00:01:54.880 okay, cool. As I said, guys, we'll keep
00:01:56.240 a [sighs]
00:01:58.240 uh
00:01:59.759 keep monitoring it as time goes on. Uh
00:02:02.640 good news is audio is solid. So, with
00:02:05.119 that being said, um yeah, just frame
00:02:08.080 rate issues. We got multiple softwares
00:02:10.160 working at the same time. So, I said
00:02:11.440 we'll try our best. So, with that being
00:02:12.959 said, uh Tristan, if you can pull up the
00:02:14.959 presentation and hopefully once the
00:02:16.959 presentation goes on, uh it should be a
00:02:19.520 little bit better.
00:02:24.480 All right, cool. All right, with that
00:02:27.120 being said,
00:02:29.360 you can see my screen. All good to go,
00:02:30.959 guys. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
00:02:34.720 Let me know. All right. Well, welcome to
00:02:36.879 the AI Income Workshop. Uh, let me just
00:02:41.599 see if all is good. Uh, Justin, we still
00:02:45.360 having issues with the frame rate on
00:02:46.720 video.
00:02:48.080 >> Yeah. Okay, no worries.
00:02:51.920 Lovely. Lovely. So, we're not going to
00:02:53.920 do split screen.
00:02:55.599 >> It's just Do you want me to remove the
00:02:57.200 split screen?
00:02:57.920 >> Uh, no. You know, uh, uh, with the prep,
00:03:01.440 >> uh, you know, we're doing it before.
00:03:02.720 >> Yeah.
00:03:03.040 >> So, are we doing uh lower third or or
00:03:05.920 split? We're doing lower third. All
00:03:08.319 right, cool. No worries, guys. I said we
00:03:10.480 will monitor it. If things go well,
00:03:12.319 we'll try bring it up to split screen.
00:03:13.920 Basically, just you guys understand uh
00:03:15.760 we're running it through another
00:03:17.120 software now, uh as in the actual
00:03:19.200 visuals because we were meant to do
00:03:20.319 split screen for today's presentation.
00:03:22.000 So, uh yeah, we'll keep you updated on
00:03:25.920 how things go.
00:03:30.720 All right. Cool, cool, cool. All right.
00:03:32.879 Well, anyways, with all that being said,
00:03:34.879 I want to give you a warm welcome to the
00:03:36.080 AI income workshop. Guys, can you just
00:03:38.319 drop in the chat if you've ever come to
00:03:39.920 a free training or a workshop and you
00:03:41.680 left as if maybe you didn't get the
00:03:43.280 experience you wanted or you felt like
00:03:45.440 you got your time wasted or you just you
00:03:47.360 kind of felt like you left empty-handed.
00:03:49.200 Let me know in the chat if you guys have
00:03:50.560 ever experienced that. As I said, if
00:03:52.480 you've had like high hopes for a
00:03:54.959 presentation or a workshop or anything
00:03:57.120 along those lines and you know, you just
00:03:59.120 didn't uh really get the experience you
00:04:00.799 wanted.
00:04:02.319 Uh,
00:04:04.799 yes, sure. 100%.
00:04:07.360 Uh, way too relatable. Yes,
00:04:09.280 unfortunately. Um, all right. Well,
00:04:12.400 yeah, guys, look, I understand it. And I
00:04:15.040 basically just wanted to address that
00:04:16.160 head on before we went into today's
00:04:18.238 presentation. Okay. Because if you've
00:04:20.000 been to one of those events in the past
00:04:21.279 or maybe even one of my own, this is
00:04:22.960 going to be very, very different. First
00:04:25.360 of all, we are going to cover a lot.
00:04:26.880 Even for me, this is going to be the
00:04:28.080 most technical event I have ever hosted.
00:04:30.479 is going to be step by step and it's
00:04:32.240 going to be in detail. In fact, you
00:04:34.000 should have gotten some in insane free
00:04:35.840 resources already with a 2026 plan of
00:04:38.639 attack that you got when you registered
00:04:40.080 for the workshop. Inside of it, I shared
00:04:42.080 my freedom framework, a personal time
00:04:44.320 audit exercise, a goal prioritization
00:04:46.560 cheat sheet, my [snorts] reverse
00:04:48.080 engineering blue uh blueprint that turns
00:04:50.160 impossible goals into inevitable goals,
00:04:52.800 and finally the 2026 plan of attack
00:04:55.280 calendar. Can you guys just let me know
00:04:56.400 in the chat if you guys have uh gotten
00:04:58.639 those? If you guys have gone through
00:04:59.919 those, if you guys have enjoyed those
00:05:01.759 free resources,
00:05:03.919 let me know because I got plenty plenty
00:05:06.880 more. But I just wanted to send those as
00:05:08.960 a a quick little teaser of some of the
00:05:11.199 free value that you're going to get
00:05:12.400 before the challenge even starts. Yes,
00:05:14.160 yes, yes, yes. Some nos. Uh once again,
00:05:16.960 if you didn't get that, that's because
00:05:18.320 you haven't signed up. So, I think there
00:05:19.680 is a link down below um if you do want
00:05:22.080 those free resources or my team will
00:05:23.600 drop in the chat. I think there's a link
00:05:25.280 you can um uh in fact go straight to uh
00:05:28.960 WhatsApp and ask for the free resource
00:05:30.800 and it'll literally send a message to
00:05:32.400 you. So yeah, from today onwards we also
00:05:35.759 have fullblown workbooks for each
00:05:38.240 session. This isn't like some three-page
00:05:40.160 [ __ ] okay? It is a 30-page
00:05:42.080 step-by-step plug-and-play workbook. Let
00:05:44.160 me give you a little sneak peek of what
00:05:46.080 you get in today's workbook at the end
00:05:48.160 of our session. For example, I added a
00:05:50.000 90-day action plan with daily and weekly
00:05:52.400 actions to apply the four-step method
00:05:54.560 that I'm going to share today. You get a
00:05:56.320 progress tracker for the strategy. I've
00:05:58.320 also added a list of 200 plus industries
00:06:01.520 you can apply this strategy to or
00:06:04.479 anytime there's any sort of calculations
00:06:06.319 or mental arithmetics. I really just
00:06:07.840 want to make it as easy as humanly
00:06:09.360 possible for you. So, I literally built
00:06:11.039 a full calculator for you to use. Okay?
00:06:13.759 And this is just day one. There are four
00:06:16.080 more workbooks throughout this week,
00:06:18.160 guys. This I know the frame rate is
00:06:21.440 still struggling at the moment. Uh but
00:06:23.280 this is what some of these workbooks
00:06:25.440 look like. So, you're going to get all
00:06:27.759 five of these workbooks. Uh these are
00:06:30.160 all pages and pages. And this is
00:06:32.560 basically my free gift to you. Okay. So,
00:06:36.000 the entire premise of this event is
00:06:39.280 basically I know that for 99% of you
00:06:42.319 guys, you are just going to want to do
00:06:43.759 it yourself. Okay. And uh there's going
00:06:46.000 to be 1% of you guys that want it done
00:06:48.080 for you. So, with all that being said,
00:06:51.120 all right, you don't need to do it now.
00:06:52.720 Okay. Just understand that uh to get
00:06:54.880 access to those um you have to be inside
00:06:57.360 the uh the groups. Uh and somewhere
00:06:59.759 throughout this presentation, I'm going
00:07:00.960 to give you guys the password. Okay? So,
00:07:02.800 these workbooks are password protected.
00:07:04.639 So, at the end of the presentation, once
00:07:06.560 we're done with everything, okay, once
00:07:07.919 we're done with the presentation, the
00:07:08.960 Q&amp;A, stuff like that, at the end of the
00:07:10.880 presentation, you guys are going to get
00:07:12.000 the password. Okay? uh and each day
00:07:14.319 we're going to do that uh as the daily
00:07:15.759 sessions go on if you are here live we
00:07:17.840 are going to give you access to all this
00:07:19.199 okay so when I share the password later
00:07:20.960 I'm also going to send you the link to
00:07:22.319 join the WhatsApp group in case you
00:07:24.160 haven't yet so I know a lot of you guys
00:07:26.720 really want all of this workbook stuff
00:07:28.720 all right you want all these but please
00:07:31.680 do not worry okay focus on today's
00:07:34.479 presentation because today's
00:07:35.440 presentation okay none of this stuff is
00:07:37.520 going to make sense unless you actually
00:07:39.199 focus and you give your full undivided
00:07:41.680 attention to today uh today's
00:07:44.080 presentation. All right. Uh so I will
00:07:46.880 send you guys all that later. All right.
00:07:49.759 So with all that being said, I'm just
00:07:51.680 going to go ahead and overd deliver in
00:07:53.199 value. Let me know guys, is that okay
00:07:55.199 with you? Let me know in the chat is
00:07:56.720 that good with you if I overd deliver in
00:07:58.720 value. And my promise is to you is that
00:08:01.199 by the end I will show you how to do
00:08:02.960 this whole process yourself. That is the
00:08:05.120 promise I've made and I will stick to
00:08:06.720 that promise. Now for 99% of you guys,
00:08:09.440 you will want to do it yourself. Okay,
00:08:12.319 just like uh you know 99% of people in
00:08:14.560 life when uh they will want to go for
00:08:16.479 the general ticket at an amusement park
00:08:18.720 but there's 1% that will want the fast
00:08:21.199 track. In our case here it is a done for
00:08:23.919 you solution. So if you're like you know
00:08:26.160 what all of this looks super great but
00:08:28.240 it's a little complicated and it's a
00:08:30.160 little bit too much time. So I would
00:08:31.440 just rather take the fast track. Okay,
00:08:33.679 that's why at the end once I fulfill my
00:08:35.679 promise, okay, if it's all right with
00:08:37.519 you and once I've helped the 99% for the
00:08:40.399 1% that's left, I have something that I
00:08:42.320 would like to present to you. Okay, does
00:08:43.519 that sound fair enough to you once I
00:08:44.800 fulfill my promise to the 99%. All
00:08:46.959 right, so with that being said, let's
00:08:48.560 get into it. Over the last few months, I
00:08:50.080 made one of the most significant
00:08:51.200 discoveries of my career. I uncovered
00:08:52.959 one specific approach that today I
00:08:54.959 consider to be the easiest way to create
00:08:57.040 an online income because this is the
00:08:59.040 only approach that lets you combine the
00:09:00.959 power of AI with an untapped market that
00:09:03.600 was previously inaccessible to
00:09:05.200 beginners. One that doesn't require you
00:09:07.440 to quit your current occupation or burn
00:09:09.519 through all of your savings just to give
00:09:11.360 it a try. In fact, it allows you to
00:09:13.519 start risk-f free, work part-time, scale
00:09:16.000 up to big numbers with next to no
00:09:17.600 upfront costs, and see quick results.
00:09:19.920 All of that without having to show your
00:09:21.680 face online, without having any previous
00:09:23.519 business experience or even having your
00:09:25.519 own product. And by the way, guys, this
00:09:27.120 is something I used to do back in the
00:09:28.640 day or it was kind of like a cousin to
00:09:30.480 this. Okay? It wasn't the exact same
00:09:32.080 thing, but it was a slight different
00:09:33.360 variation of this. But I'll be honest,
00:09:36.080 it was something that for a long time I
00:09:37.760 thought was impossible for most people
00:09:39.440 to get into unless you were an expert
00:09:42.160 like I am. It used to be high skill or
00:09:44.959 sorry, it used to be a high-skll
00:09:46.320 high-profit business. But with the
00:09:48.480 recent developments in AI over the last
00:09:50.160 year, it's become a high-profit,
00:09:52.240 low-skll business, which is really the
00:09:54.160 best thing that you can have because it
00:09:55.440 means it is now possible for some
00:09:57.120 beginners to get into this for the first
00:09:59.279 time ever. This way, you can dip your
00:10:01.279 toes in the water virtually without risk
00:10:03.120 and get into this new type of business
00:10:04.800 before the big waves comes in. And I
00:10:06.560 personally believe this is the simplest
00:10:08.080 and most straightforward way to build an
00:10:10.399 online income in 2026. And here is why.
00:10:13.680 Right now, there is something quirky
00:10:15.279 happening on the internet. There are
00:10:16.880 more and more people ever who control
00:10:18.800 massive responsive audiences and they
00:10:21.120 have no idea how to make money with
00:10:22.880 them. They have done the hard part. 99%
00:10:25.279 of the work that could turn into profit,
00:10:27.360 but they need someone to help them with
00:10:29.360 the 1%. Okay? Until that happens, they
00:10:32.079 make zero. After that happens, it could
00:10:35.440 be hundreds of thousands of dollars of
00:10:37.680 which you could take 30%. Okay? Now, I
00:10:40.720 want to be very realistic. There's
00:10:42.079 actually I've spoken to people. I was on
00:10:44.000 the phone two weeks ago. I was on the
00:10:45.760 phone to someone who literally does
00:10:47.600 this. Okay, this is their they've been
00:10:49.120 doing this for years and years and they
00:10:50.399 actually it's opposite way around. They
00:10:51.839 take 80% and the other person takes 20.
00:10:54.000 Okay, and you know most sort of
00:10:56.240 arrangements like this most partnerships
00:10:58.000 it's 50/50. Now the reason I'm saying
00:10:59.920 30% is because as you start in this
00:11:02.240 journey you might only take 30%. Okay,
00:11:05.200 and that's fine. Okay, because you're
00:11:06.640 getting you're getting your first
00:11:07.519 partnerships through the door. you're
00:11:08.880 you're getting, you know, you're dipping
00:11:10.000 your toes in this model and as time goes
00:11:12.160 on, um, you know, that percentage will
00:11:14.079 go bigger and bigger. One thing I just
00:11:16.560 want you guys to know during uh,
00:11:18.160 basically the next uh, you know, our 5
00:11:20.079 days of the workshop and let me know if
00:11:21.440 that's okay with you guys. I'm just
00:11:23.440 going to keep it no [ __ ] okay? I'm
00:11:24.959 not going to try to sugarcoat things.
00:11:26.320 I'm not going to try to make things seem
00:11:28.000 easier than they are because the truth
00:11:29.760 is whenever you do it yourself, time and
00:11:32.399 effort is associated to it. Now, of
00:11:33.920 course, there's things that you can do.
00:11:34.880 As I said, you know, for the 1% of
00:11:36.880 people, they will want it done for them.
00:11:38.320 But for the 99% of people that go the uh
00:11:41.040 uh do-it-yourself route and the manual
00:11:42.560 route, I'm going to give you all the
00:11:43.920 playbooks. I'm going to show you
00:11:44.880 literally everything to do, but it takes
00:11:46.399 a lot of time and it takes a lot of
00:11:47.600 work. Okay? So, with all that being
00:11:49.680 said, this is a process, okay? I'm not
00:11:52.320 going to sugarcoat things. And even when
00:11:54.160 it comes to percentages, I actually was
00:11:56.160 speaking to someone and they wanted to
00:11:57.920 do something like this where it was 7030
00:11:59.920 our way, okay? So, they kept 30% and
00:12:01.920 this is a super super super well-known
00:12:03.839 person. They kept 30% and we keep kept
00:12:06.320 70%. But that takes time, okay? As you
00:12:08.880 get more and more advanced, you can uh,
00:12:10.560 you know, command these sort of
00:12:11.760 percentages. But I want to keep it
00:12:13.200 realistic throughout this presentation,
00:12:14.480 which I hope you guys appreciate that
00:12:16.240 I'm not just going to come in and use
00:12:17.760 unrealistic numbers with you guys. Okay.
00:12:20.000 The reason this opportunity exists right
00:12:21.680 now is that you only need to get this
00:12:23.519 right once to make this work. And that
00:12:25.600 is going to be our theme for this
00:12:26.800 workshop. This whole idea of one, we're
00:12:29.279 going to do it all from the perspective
00:12:30.639 of the rule of one. The rule of one
00:12:32.720 states that if you do one thing, just
00:12:34.639 one thing well, you will be way better
00:12:36.639 off than trying to do 10 things at once.
00:12:38.800 In this online industry, people fail not
00:12:40.800 because they lack options, but because
00:12:42.480 they actually have too many and then
00:12:44.240 they try them all at the same time. So,
00:12:46.639 I want to go the opposite end of the
00:12:48.399 spectrum with this workshop.
00:12:54.399 My objective today is not show you a
00:12:56.880 bunch of different ways to create a side
00:12:58.399 hustle or a full-time business. No, no,
00:13:00.079 no. I have one goal for this workshop.
00:13:02.240 To show you one strategy, to give you
00:13:04.079 one action plan that has one objective,
00:13:06.720 okay? To show you how to get one single
00:13:08.320 partnership that can pay you 5,000,
00:13:10.000 10,000, even 50,000 beyond. Okay? As a
00:13:13.200 oneperson business. This is the exact
00:13:15.680 approach that you would have laid you'll
00:13:17.279 have laid out in front of you today by
00:13:18.800 the end of our uh the first of our five
00:13:21.040 sessions of the AI income workshop. Now,
00:13:23.680 look, generally day one is more about
00:13:25.440 the opportunity and less about the step
00:13:26.959 by step, but this is so straightforward
00:13:28.560 that we're just going to dive straight
00:13:29.760 into the step by step today already. So,
00:13:32.240 here's how we're going to do this
00:13:33.200 together. I have a great presentation
00:13:34.880 here that I prepared for the last 5
00:13:36.399 weeks that should go on for about an
00:13:37.760 hour and a half. Again, there's going to
00:13:39.360 be a lot of step-by-step technical
00:13:40.880 training. And since this is a workshop,
00:13:42.720 it means that you need to work. Okay?
00:13:44.480 Just sitting here and watching what I
00:13:45.920 show you is not enough. You need to put
00:13:47.519 it into practice. So, that is the very
00:13:50.160 first agreement that we need to have
00:13:51.360 here. Do you commit to taking action on
00:13:53.839 all the tasks that I show you today,
00:13:55.680 even if they're a bit hard at first and
00:13:57.600 might require a few weeks of hard work?
00:13:59.440 Okay, let me know in the chat. Are you
00:14:01.279 okay with that? Perfect. If that's the
00:14:04.160 case, well, for all the tasks and all
00:14:06.160 the step-by-step content, as I said,
00:14:07.600 you're going to find them in today's
00:14:08.639 workbook. In fact, for any part where I
00:14:10.720 think you might get stuck with numbers
00:14:12.000 or anything, I've built extra tools and
00:14:13.920 extra resources to make sure that not a
00:14:15.760 single person gets left behind. Every s
00:14:18.079 every session will have its own workbook
00:14:19.760 with all the details that you need. You
00:14:21.600 can download them inside the WhatsApp
00:14:23.199 group protected with a pass password. As
00:14:25.440 I said, you don't need to worry about
00:14:26.320 this. I'm going to share all this stuff
00:14:27.680 at the end of the session. So, for now,
00:14:29.600 and once again, everything that is in
00:14:31.360 the workbook won't mean anything. Okay?
00:14:33.360 You'll have literally zero value unless
00:14:35.040 you focus throughout the presentation.
00:14:37.120 Okay? You can only get it if you are
00:14:38.959 here live with us today. Now, at the
00:14:40.959 end, I've also brought on a special
00:14:42.639 co-host, Jason Fladdlin. He applies this
00:14:44.880 exact strategy that I'm going to share
00:14:46.240 with you today, and he's probably the
00:14:47.760 best in the world at it. Okay? Over his
00:14:49.600 career, he's generated over 100 million
00:14:51.360 with a strategy, including 57 million
00:14:53.920 just from one single partnership. He is
00:14:55.920 going to be tracking your questions
00:14:57.120 during the session. After the main
00:14:58.800 presentation, we're going to hang out in
00:15:00.480 a more informal Q&amp;A to answer all these
00:15:02.800 questions and make sure you have
00:15:04.000 everything you need to kill it over the
00:15:05.760 next few days of the workshop. But you
00:15:08.079 need to be there live to join us for the
00:15:09.680 Q&amp;A because it get cuts off or sorry, it
00:15:11.920 gets cut after the live session ends.
00:15:14.079 Then starting today, we're also going to
00:15:15.600 start bringing in some special extra
00:15:17.279 guest speakers, all of whom have made
00:15:19.199 lots of money with this exact same
00:15:20.959 strategy, and they're going to share
00:15:22.320 some of their secrets. Okay? They're
00:15:23.600 going to come on stage right after the
00:15:25.040 Q&amp;A. So that way, you'll be able to be
00:15:27.279 uh so that way you'll need to be here
00:15:28.880 live in order to see that. Now,
00:15:32.000 let me be completely transparent about
00:15:33.680 why I'm hosting this workshop for free
00:15:35.199 and why I'm so convinced that this is
00:15:37.120 the best beginner business model for
00:15:38.560 2026. You see, I've made over a 100
00:15:40.720 million in online sales across every
00:15:42.639 business model under the sun. Services,
00:15:44.720 affiliate marketing, physical products,
00:15:46.480 high ticket, software, AI, you name it.
00:15:48.959 Okay? But by far, the business that made
00:15:52.000 me the most money was digital products.
00:15:53.920 And because of that success, I invested
00:15:55.759 a large part of my net worth in by
00:15:58.240 writing a massive check to become a
00:16:00.079 co-owner of [ __ ] the fastest growing
00:16:02.079 digital product platform in the world.
00:16:03.759 Our users have earned over $2 billion
00:16:06.320 from their digital products. Right now,
00:16:07.759 people are making about $200 million a
00:16:09.680 month on our platform with over a
00:16:11.759 billion in the last 6 months alone. That
00:16:14.000 is 166 uh million a month averaged in
00:16:17.600 the last 6 months. Uh 5.48 million a
00:16:20.240 day, 228,000 an hour. Okay? Or if you
00:16:24.240 want to think about it this way, if you
00:16:25.759 earned $100,000 per year, it would take
00:16:27.839 you about 20,000 years to earn 2
00:16:30.399 billion. That is twice as long as all of
00:16:32.959 recorded humani civilization. That is
00:16:35.199 how much our users have earned with
00:16:36.800 their digital products. And as a
00:16:38.160 co-owner of WAP, I have back-end access
00:16:40.320 to the payment processing of tens of
00:16:42.240 thousands of verified individuals
00:16:43.839 earning money from digital products
00:16:45.600 right now. So, I can see everything.
00:16:47.199 Okay? I can see exactly who's
00:16:48.560 succeeding, how much they're making, and
00:16:50.560 what they are doing differently. Now,
00:16:52.560 here's what I've noticed with all this
00:16:53.920 data. There is a massive opportunity
00:16:56.320 that almost no one is talking about. You
00:16:57.920 see, right now there are millions of
00:16:59.440 what we call these micro creators.
00:17:01.120 People with 10,000 to 100,000 followers
00:17:03.360 on Instagram, YouTube or Tik Tok who
00:17:05.760 have built engaged and responsive
00:17:07.439 audiences, but they're making nothing
00:17:09.439 from them. Maybe a few hundred dollars
00:17:11.039 here and there from sponsorship posts.
00:17:12.720 Okay, meanwhile, they're are sitting on
00:17:15.199 gold mines. Their audiences trust them.
00:17:17.359 They follow them daily daily and they
00:17:19.359 want to learn from them. But these
00:17:20.959 creators have no idea how to turn that
00:17:22.720 demand into real money. They don't know
00:17:24.880 how to create products. They don't know
00:17:26.480 how to launch. Okay? They don't know how
00:17:27.919 to monetize properly. They have done 99%
00:17:30.559 of the hard work building the audience.
00:17:32.640 Now they just need someone to help them
00:17:34.320 with the final 1% turning it into
00:17:36.640 profit. And because of the recent
00:17:38.240 advancements in AI, you can now be that
00:17:40.640 person. You can help them create a
00:17:42.400 digital product based on their existing
00:17:44.080 content and monetize their audiences
00:17:46.559 with this digital product. Okay? And you
00:17:49.039 can do all of that without needing to be
00:17:50.880 an expert yourself, without showing your
00:17:52.720 face, or without having your own
00:17:54.720 product. So guys, let's address the
00:17:56.880 elephant in the room here. Okay, I
00:17:59.360 understand what you're thinking. If
00:18:00.480 you're so rich, if you made over nine
00:18:02.080 figures from this industry, if you're a
00:18:03.280 co-owner in a multi-billion dollar
00:18:04.720 company, why are you doing this? Okay,
00:18:06.720 we all know that people don't do things
00:18:08.480 out of the goodness of their own heart.
00:18:09.919 Okay, I consider myself a very kind
00:18:12.160 person. But in all honesty, I spent I
00:18:14.799 spent months and months, okay? You know,
00:18:16.000 the whole prep, the presentations,
00:18:17.760 everything that's gone into this, I've
00:18:18.960 spent months, okay, putting together all
00:18:20.880 these free resources for you. And
00:18:22.640 everyone's got a reason, okay? So, let
00:18:24.720 me just go ahead and lay my cards on the
00:18:26.640 table and just be 100% honest and
00:18:29.200 transparent with you. I have three
00:18:30.960 reasons why I'm doing this for you
00:18:32.640 today. Reason number one, as I said, I
00:18:35.120 am co-owner of [ __ ] I have the largest
00:18:37.039 part of my net worth tied up in [ __ ] as
00:18:39.120 most very wealthy people have their net
00:18:41.120 worth tied up in their main company. And
00:18:43.039 my goal is to build [ __ ] to be a hundred
00:18:44.880 billion dollar company. And
00:18:45.840 astonishingly, we are getting there.
00:18:47.600 We're on pace to do it. But I would like
00:18:49.039 to do it even quicker. Our model works
00:18:51.360 off of performance. So the more you guys
00:18:53.440 make, we take a very tiny tiny
00:18:55.440 percentage of that, similar to how
00:18:57.120 private banks work. The richer their
00:18:58.799 clients get, the richer they get as a
00:19:00.640 bank. Reason number two, another one of
00:19:02.799 my most recent acquisitions is a
00:19:04.400 9-figure consulting firm called
00:19:06.320 Consulting.com, which was previously
00:19:08.000 owned by Sam Ovenans and Reendors. And
00:19:10.320 this is my day job. Okay. The company
00:19:12.720 was established in 2016, but I purchased
00:19:15.200 it last year. And we have become the
00:19:16.880 number one consulting firm in the world
00:19:18.799 for knowledge and digital product
00:19:20.240 businesses. Our pricing for enterprise
00:19:22.320 clients starts at $25,000. So if even
00:19:26.559 just 0.1% of you guys succeed with us
00:19:29.039 today and become an enterprise client of
00:19:31.120 ours at a consulting.com, that's an
00:19:33.440 extra $25 million in revenue for the
00:19:35.679 business. Reason number three, as I
00:19:37.600 said, 99% of you guys will take
00:19:40.080 everything I'm saying here today, take
00:19:41.919 all of the literal 100 pages of
00:19:43.760 workbooks, the tools, all the training,
00:19:45.440 and go, you know what, I'm going to do
00:19:47.840 this myself. But there is 1% of you guys
00:19:51.039 that will want it done for you. So, if
00:19:54.080 you take the do-it-yourself way, you
00:19:56.320 have to execute everything manually.
00:19:58.160 You're going to learn how to take
00:19:59.200 advantage of this, but you're going to
00:20:00.640 have to put in the hours and hours of
00:20:02.160 manual labor in order to accomplish it.
00:20:04.559 It works. People make money with it, but
00:20:06.799 of course, it requires time, effort, and
00:20:09.120 a lot of manual labor. Way number two is
00:20:11.600 the done for you way, okay? Where you
00:20:13.520 get all the specialized AI tools and the
00:20:15.600 softwares that automate 90% of the
00:20:17.520 execution. And in fact, even my own team
00:20:20.240 manually executing a part of the process
00:20:22.880 for you. So instead of spending a 100
00:20:25.200 hours per partnership, you could be
00:20:26.960 spending less than 5 hours. This is what
00:20:28.720 I will offer you at the end of today's
00:20:30.240 session because I am so convinced that
00:20:32.720 by the end of today, you will see
00:20:34.159 everything you need to make a decision.
00:20:36.240 You will understand the complete
00:20:37.520 strategy and you will understand exactly
00:20:39.600 how it works. And for those of you guys
00:20:40.960 who want to move fast, who want the done
00:20:42.880 for you option, I'm going to have some
00:20:44.640 special bonuses for people who sign up
00:20:46.799 before the end of today's session. But
00:20:48.559 regardless of whether you join or not,
00:20:50.640 you are going to get the complete system
00:20:52.240 today step by step, the manual way,
00:20:55.679 everything you need to execute your
00:20:57.280 first 10, 20, or even $50,000
00:21:00.640 deal. So, if you can commit to this one
00:21:04.480 method and resist all of the endless
00:21:06.320 options shoved in your face online, you
00:21:08.480 will never need to watch another make
00:21:10.159 money online video again. Does that
00:21:12.640 sound fair enough? Let me know. I'm
00:21:14.080 going to check the chat and I'm going to
00:21:15.280 have a little swig of water and we shall
00:21:18.880 go from there.
00:21:23.280 Beautiful. Beautiful. Let me know if
00:21:24.960 that sounds good to you guys. Yes. Yes.
00:21:26.720 Yes. Yes. Yes. All right. Beautiful.
00:21:31.440 Guys, just let me know on the audio and
00:21:33.600 the visuals. I know visuals, I'm
00:21:35.200 assuming, is still a little uh shaky.
00:21:37.520 Audio, I think, is all good. Let me know
00:21:39.120 on the visuals how it's looking
00:21:41.039 potentially.
00:21:42.720 Um, we might have to I'll ask uh Tristan
00:21:45.919 in just a second. Um, we might have to
00:21:49.360 uh turn off visuals just for today.
00:21:51.360 We'll get it sorted for tomorrow, guys.
00:21:52.640 We've done so many live streams uh and
00:21:54.720 this is the first time ever. So, as that
00:21:56.400 I'll just ask uh Tristan in a second.
00:21:58.960 Um, visuals are mid and audio all good.
00:22:02.240 Video is great now. Okay, audio is good.
00:22:04.400 Um,
00:22:06.320 uh,
00:22:07.840 someone says you talk too fast. I
00:22:09.520 apologize. I have a lot to get through.
00:22:11.440 I'll try my best. It's a combination of
00:22:13.520 I have a lot to get through and I'm
00:22:14.960 actually very very excited. Um, I hope
00:22:17.120 that comes through. Um, audio okay, bit
00:22:19.440 rate not. Uh, quality nice but video is
00:22:21.919 choppy. Yeah, guys, we will uh assess
00:22:24.159 the situation. As I said, I'll I'll have
00:22:25.919 a chat with Tristan shortly and uh we'll
00:22:28.320 see best route to go.
00:22:32.080 All right. Well, getting back to it,
00:22:34.080 let's go ahead and dive into it. I have
00:22:35.520 something to confess here. This strategy
00:22:37.039 I'm showing you today allows you to tap
00:22:38.720 into audiences or sorry, that allows you
00:22:40.480 to tap into audiences of tens of
00:22:42.240 thousands is actually nothing new in
00:22:44.080 other industries. I'm sure you guys are
00:22:45.280 all sat here today and you're going,
00:22:46.880 he's gonna show us something that's
00:22:48.080 never been done before. We're the first
00:22:49.679 person on earth to ever do this. No,
00:22:51.760 this is actually very common and
00:22:52.960 actually that should put you at ease
00:22:54.240 because it should show you people make
00:22:56.720 so much money with this in other
00:22:58.400 industries. We're just taking something
00:22:59.679 that works in another industry. We're
00:23:01.520 using the power of AI to basically
00:23:03.440 enable it to work in our industry, okay?
00:23:05.679 And we're applying it to one specific
00:23:07.280 market.
00:23:09.120 As I said, some of the most successful
00:23:10.640 people in the world have been using this
00:23:12.080 exact model for decades. It's just that
00:23:14.559 none of them talk about it. Why? Because
00:23:16.480 the people making money with it stay in
00:23:18.480 the shadows. I'm gonna pull back the
00:23:20.240 curtain and show you exactly how this
00:23:21.840 works across multiple industries. Uh,
00:23:24.000 real quick, Tristan, what do you think?
00:23:25.120 Should we keep video on or should we
00:23:26.640 turn it off?
00:23:28.559 >> We can We're gonna try another reset.
00:23:30.880 Turns the video feed off, but the audio
00:23:32.960 keeps going.
00:23:33.760 >> Cool.
00:23:34.640 >> We'll leave it up to you guys. I say,
00:23:37.520 let me let me know if you guys have ever
00:23:38.799 had this in the chat. Like have you guys
00:23:40.080 ever prepared and practiced and done
00:23:42.960 something like for so long and it's
00:23:44.960 always works flawlessly and then on the
00:23:46.720 day there's like one small tiny little
00:23:48.320 hookup and you're like of course of
00:23:49.600 course on the day this is going to
00:23:50.880 happen. Um so we've literally run
00:23:52.799 through this dozens and dozens of times.
00:23:54.400 So apologies but um yeah hopefully this
00:23:57.520 should just show you. One of the issues
00:23:59.520 when you are presenting to I can see
00:24:00.960 right here last when I checked it was
00:24:02.720 87,000 people live. So yeah that's one
00:24:05.200 of the downsides. Um, I appreciate you
00:24:07.679 guys uh showing up today and um, you
00:24:09.679 know, giving me your undivided
00:24:10.720 attention. Um, we just literally have
00:24:13.919 the largest football stadium you can
00:24:15.840 imagine watching this concurrently. Um,
00:24:18.320 so yeah, we'll uh, uh, assess the
00:24:20.159 situation as time goes on. So, with all
00:24:23.200 that being said, that should actually
00:24:24.880 put you at ease, okay? That you
00:24:26.240 understand that this isn't some like new
00:24:27.760 internet thing that I just made up,
00:24:29.039 okay? This is a proven business model
00:24:30.400 that's created billions of dollars
00:24:31.760 across entertainment, sports,
00:24:33.279 publishing, and more. Let me show you.
00:24:35.279 Think about the music industry for a
00:24:36.640 second, okay? When you go to a concert
00:24:38.400 and see someone like Drake or Taylor
00:24:39.919 Swift performing in front of 50,000
00:24:41.760 people, who do you think is making more
00:24:43.440 money from that show? Is it
00:24:46.400 the artist on stage or the person that
00:24:49.279 you've never heard of, the manager, the
00:24:50.640 agent, the promoter who operates
00:24:52.000 completely in the shadows? Well, let me
00:24:53.919 tell you about a guy called Scooter
00:24:55.120 Braun. You've probably never heard of
00:24:56.400 his name, but you've definitely heard of
00:24:57.760 his clients. Justin Bieber, Ariana
00:24:59.679 Grande, Demi Lovado. Scooter doesn't
00:25:01.679 perform. He doesn't sing. He doesn't
00:25:03.039 need to be an influencer to make money.
00:25:04.640 Okay. But every time Justin Bieber's
00:25:06.480 song plays on the radio, Scooter gets
00:25:08.080 paid. Every time Ariana Grande sells out
00:25:10.320 a stadium, Scooter gets paid. Every time
00:25:12.720 a brand pays Demi Lovado for an
00:25:14.400 endorsement, well, Scooter gets paid. He
00:25:16.720 tapped into their audience. He operates
00:25:18.960 behind the scenes and he's worth a cool
00:25:21.679 $400 million. Okay? Now, 99.9% of people
00:25:24.960 who listen to Justin Bieber don't even
00:25:26.400 know that Scooter exists. But he is
00:25:28.480 laughing all the way to the bank. Or
00:25:30.799 let's look at sports. When LeBron James
00:25:32.799 uh James signs a $154 million contract
00:25:35.279 with the Lakers, who negotiated that
00:25:37.120 deal? When he signed a $1 billion
00:25:39.200 lifetime deal with Nike, who structured
00:25:41.120 that? Rich Paul, his agent. LeBron has
00:25:43.840 the audience. He has the millions of
00:25:45.520 fans who buy jerseys and watch games.
00:25:47.440 But Rich Paul, he is operating in the
00:25:49.600 shadows. He extract he's extracting
00:25:51.440 massive value from that audience without
00:25:53.840 ever playing a single game. He takes 3
00:25:56.320 to 4% of every deal, sometimes more. And
00:25:58.559 that is millions of dollars a year for
00:26:00.720 being the operator. Not the talent, not
00:26:03.039 the face, but the operator. Okay? And
00:26:05.520 here's the beautiful part. LeBron needs
00:26:07.279 Rich Paul because LeBron, he's great at
00:26:09.360 basketball, but he doesn't want to
00:26:10.640 negotiate contracts. He doesn't want to
00:26:11.840 manage sponsorships. He doesn't want to
00:26:13.440 handle legal paperwork or deal with
00:26:15.360 endorsement offers. That is not what
00:26:17.120 he's good at, and that is not what he
00:26:18.640 wants to do. So, he pays someone else
00:26:20.960 handsomely, by the way, to operate that
00:26:22.960 part of his business. And that is the
00:26:24.640 case with every single industry out
00:26:26.559 there. There are always a few specific
00:26:28.559 parts of the business that the person
00:26:30.080 with the audience doesn't want to deal
00:26:31.760 with. Okay? And that is actually where
00:26:33.840 the opportunity lives. Let's take the
00:26:35.440 publishing world. You know, I'm sure you
00:26:37.200 guys all know JK Rowling. Okay? She
00:26:38.960 wrote Harry Potter. But do you know who
00:26:41.120 Christopher Little is? He is the agent
00:26:43.200 who took Harry Potter from a rejected
00:26:45.200 manuscript to a multi-billion dollar
00:26:47.279 global franchise. Every book sold, every
00:26:49.440 movie deal, every theme park attraction,
00:26:51.360 and every piece of merchandise.
00:26:53.120 Christopher Little got a cut of all of
00:26:55.760 it. Okay? Not because he wrote the
00:26:57.039 books, but because he operated the
00:26:58.400 business side, while JK Rowling focused
00:27:00.480 on writing, he tapped into her audience
00:27:02.240 of millions of readers worldwide and
00:27:04.480 operated completely in the completely in
00:27:06.159 the shadows. Most Harry Potter fans have
00:27:08.799 no idea who he is, but he became
00:27:10.400 incredibly wealthy from that single
00:27:12.159 partnership. Are you starting to
00:27:13.840 understand and are you starting to see
00:27:15.200 the pattern here? Okay. In every
00:27:16.799 industry where an audience exists,
00:27:19.360 there's always someone who's operating
00:27:21.200 in the shadows. Someone who doesn't need
00:27:22.720 to be the talent. Someone who doesn't
00:27:24.159 need to show their face. someone who
00:27:25.679 doesn't need millions of followers but
00:27:27.520 still makes massive money by operating.
00:27:30.000 Okay, this is not new. This is not some
00:27:32.000 internet hack. This is what smart money
00:27:33.919 has been doing for over a hundred years
00:27:35.919 now. The only difference is it used to
00:27:38.080 be limited to elite industries like
00:27:39.760 entertainment and sports. But now,
00:27:41.679 thanks to the internet and social media,
00:27:43.440 there are millions of creators who
00:27:45.200 engaged with engaged audiences who need
00:27:48.080 operators. Okay? people like fitness
00:27:50.799 coaches, business consu uh consultants,
00:27:52.640 language teachers, parenting experts,
00:27:54.880 relationship adviserss, uh financial ed
00:27:57.039 educators, the list goes on and on and
00:27:59.919 on, okay? And virtually zero people are
00:28:02.480 filling that operator role at scale. And
00:28:04.960 because of AI, this is now something
00:28:06.480 that everyone could get into. And I'm
00:28:08.159 going to show you how to do this in just
00:28:09.279 a second. So, here is where you come in.
00:28:12.000 Okay? Instead of spending years trying
00:28:13.440 to build your own audience from scratch,
00:28:15.279 okay, instead of trying to become the
00:28:16.799 next big influencer, instead of trying
00:28:18.000 to do some Tik Tok dances and be a
00:28:20.000 dancing monkey online and create content
00:28:21.919 and all this stuff, okay, instead of
00:28:23.520 posting every single day hoping that
00:28:25.279 people notice you, you do what the smart
00:28:27.279 money has done for decades. Instead, you
00:28:29.919 partner with someone who already has the
00:28:32.080 audience, okay? But instead of the music
00:28:33.760 industry, the sport industry, or
00:28:35.200 publishing, you do it with digital
00:28:36.880 products. Now, you might be asking, why
00:28:38.720 digital products? because that is the
00:28:40.559 only type of product that you create
00:28:41.840 once and you can sell it thousands of
00:28:43.520 times. That's because the work to
00:28:44.960 fulfill one customer or 10,000 customers
00:28:47.039 is virtually the same. And I have
00:28:48.640 personally sold the same digital product
00:28:50.320 over a thousand times in a single day,
00:28:53.200 dozens of times. And once the product is
00:28:55.679 created, that product doesn't stop
00:28:57.440 paying you. It can keep paying dividends
00:28:59.200 for years to come. For example, on [ __ ]
00:29:01.600 we have this one guy making $8,000 a
00:29:03.760 month teaching people how to create
00:29:05.039 Fortnite maps. But if you take a look at
00:29:07.279 his profile, he's made $78,000 in
00:29:09.840 lifetime earnings. Meaning, this digital
00:29:11.919 product that he created once has been
00:29:13.760 paying him for months and months. Plus,
00:29:16.000 this way, the creator you partner with
00:29:17.600 gets to stay in their zone of genius.
00:29:19.440 That's what they love doing. They want
00:29:20.880 to be the person on Tik Tok or YouTube
00:29:22.799 or Instagram. They like creating
00:29:24.240 content. They like being on camera. They
00:29:26.159 like engaging with their audience. And
00:29:27.919 you handle what they don't want to do.
00:29:29.679 Okay? They don't want to handle the
00:29:30.720 operations. They don't want to handle
00:29:31.760 that side of things. Okay? And as a
00:29:33.600 result, you get paid a percentage of the
00:29:36.080 profits. No upfront cost, no risk, no
00:29:38.240 need to show your face. That is exactly
00:29:39.840 what WP users like Zach do. This is his
00:29:43.360 W profile, and you can see he's made
00:29:45.360 $14,000 in just the last 24 hours and
00:29:48.399 $112,000
00:29:50.320 lifetime earnings. How? By partnering
00:29:52.720 with creators who talk about how exotic
00:29:54.720 uh uh talk about exotic cars and
00:29:56.720 launching a digital product on how to
00:29:58.559 run your own exotic car rental fleet.
00:30:00.640 Okay? And I actually used to run a very
00:30:02.480 similar operation myself. I would
00:30:04.320 partner with creators, help them launch
00:30:06.000 a digital product, and get a slice of
00:30:08.000 the profits. One of the first creators
00:30:09.919 that I partnered with was a company
00:30:11.360 called AJ and Smart. They actually teach
00:30:13.120 people about design sprints. That was
00:30:15.200 back when they only had a few thousand
00:30:16.640 subscribers. I helped them launch their
00:30:18.640 first digital product. Okay? And this is
00:30:21.039 actually me and them in their offices in
00:30:22.640 Berlin. I was 18 at the time back then,
00:30:24.960 right? So Jonathan, absolute legend. Um,
00:30:27.840 now they're one of the biggest names in
00:30:29.679 the space with 400,000 subscribers. Now,
00:30:32.240 funnily enough, I have always been, you
00:30:34.880 know, I'm I'm going to keep it 100% uh
00:30:37.039 real and honest with you guys. I've
00:30:38.399 always been very vocal against this
00:30:40.240 model in the past. And there was a very
00:30:42.080 specific reason for it. Okay? Even up
00:30:44.799 until like a year, year and a half ago,
00:30:46.480 I told people, &quot;Do not do this.&quot; I said,
00:30:48.799 &quot;It's very profitable. You'll make a lot
00:30:50.640 of money. It's very profitable, but it's
00:30:52.320 simply not feasible. It's simply not
00:30:54.799 possible for beginners.&quot; Okay? because
00:30:57.760 it was a very high profit endeavor but
00:31:00.240 it was high uh skill-based as well. I'm
00:31:02.960 sure you guys know something has
00:31:04.240 happened in the last uh you know year
00:31:05.520 and a half. There's certain tools
00:31:07.279 there's certain uh softwares that have
00:31:08.880 come out. Okay, there's certain things
00:31:10.399 that have changed that now all of a
00:31:11.600 sudden mean that anyone can do this.
00:31:14.159 Okay,
00:31:15.840 I'm sure you guys have seen the recent
00:31:17.760 advancements in AI. You can now take
00:31:19.440 care of this entire operation yourself.
00:31:21.120 Something that used to take a full team
00:31:22.880 of people just a few months ago. Okay.
00:31:25.200 And or sorry a few years ago and this is
00:31:27.520 why this has become the ultimate
00:31:28.720 oneperson business. What we are doing
00:31:30.640 here is creating digital products for
00:31:32.159 creators. This is the exact best use
00:31:34.399 case for AI. I mean think about it. What
00:31:36.559 is easier to leverage AI for building an
00:31:38.960 audience connection and impact. Okay.
00:31:40.880 That's hard for AI to do and that is
00:31:42.960 what creators do so well. Okay. But
00:31:45.279 taking their content and packaging that
00:31:47.279 into a digital product that is the exact
00:31:49.679 type of task that AI thrives at. So, if
00:31:53.120 I show you guys a way to implement this
00:31:54.640 all by yourself, so that way you can
00:31:56.159 start creating an in an online income
00:31:58.240 even if you're working a full-time job
00:31:59.760 right now, is that something that you
00:32:01.440 guys would be interested in? Let me know
00:32:02.880 in the chat and I will see how you guys
00:32:06.720 are fairing. Let's see where we're at.
00:32:09.519 Beautiful, beautiful,
00:32:11.919 beautiful, beautiful. Well, you guys
00:32:13.600 seem to enjoy it. Uh, yes. Uh, yes, yes,
00:32:16.240 yes, yes.
00:32:19.360 Beautiful.
00:32:22.240 Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
00:32:24.080 Yes. Okay. Cool. You guys seem happy
00:32:25.519 enough, so I'll continue. All right.
00:32:27.200 Perfect. Um All right. So, with all that
00:32:30.240 being said,
00:32:33.519 there is one practically effortless way
00:32:35.360 to do this. Okay. Now, before we get
00:32:36.480 into that, let me clarify something.
00:32:37.840 When I say creators, you're probably
00:32:39.519 thinking of creators with millions and
00:32:40.960 millions of followers. Okay? These are
00:32:42.399 not the creators I speak of. I am
00:32:44.080 talking about small creators, fitness
00:32:45.679 coaches, language teachers, business
00:32:47.279 consultants, photographers, gardening
00:32:49.440 specialists, okay? People with knowledge
00:32:51.519 about a very specific topic and with a
00:32:53.519 passionate followers who already know,
00:32:55.279 like, and trust them. These are the type
00:32:56.880 of creators you should look for that can
00:32:58.799 make serious money. Okay? These are
00:33:00.640 called micro creators. Creators with
00:33:02.880 anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000
00:33:04.799 followers that talk about a very
00:33:06.240 specific topic. I'm going to be super
00:33:07.919 honest, transparent, no [ __ ] and
00:33:09.840 just keep it 100% real with you guys. If
00:33:12.080 you reach out to macro creators, large
00:33:14.320 creators, you will get ignored. Okay?
00:33:16.720 Like, how many times have you ever come
00:33:17.840 to a workshop where someone is like,
00:33:19.279 &quot;No, if you do it this way, you will
00:33:20.880 actually fail.&quot; Like, I'm just going to
00:33:22.000 keep it honest with you. The only way
00:33:23.760 this is possible now, as time goes on,
00:33:26.799 okay? As you do, as you uh uh uh grow in
00:33:29.760 this endeavor, okay, and as you stick to
00:33:31.760 this model after year 2, three, four,
00:33:34.159 five, you can go to the largest creators
00:33:35.919 in the world and you can be taking crazy
00:33:38.000 splits, crazy cuts. You know, I was
00:33:40.000 speaking to someone I think I mentioned
00:33:41.519 earlier. I was speaking to an individual
00:33:42.799 that does this, works with one creator
00:33:44.880 and makes almost $10 million a year. And
00:33:46.640 by the way, what's really cool about
00:33:47.840 being a co-owner in WAP is I know
00:33:49.519 everyone's numbers. I know everyone's
00:33:50.559 data. So, I can validate that this is
00:33:52.000 true. So, like I actually know that this
00:33:53.279 is true from one single partnership. He
00:33:56.159 makes almost $10 million a year. I
00:33:57.919 actually sent a message earlier today to
00:33:59.360 an individual uh 21 years old making
00:34:01.679 $200,000 a month with this exact same
00:34:03.760 model. Okay. So, that's not, you know,
00:34:05.840 that's not what they were doing uh when
00:34:07.840 they first start out. Okay. when they
00:34:09.119 first started out, they went for micro
00:34:10.800 creators. Okay? If you go for macro
00:34:12.159 creators, I'm going to be honest with
00:34:13.679 you, this model isn't going to work.
00:34:14.960 Okay? This training isn't work going to
00:34:16.480 work. This methodology isn't going to
00:34:17.839 work. So, instead, you have to focus on
00:34:19.599 micro creators. Now, what actually is a
00:34:22.159 microcreator,
00:34:23.679 okay? Uh and by the way, just so you
00:34:25.679 guys understand another example of a
00:34:27.040 person that did this, Zach. Okay? He
00:34:28.639 partnered with a creator. This creator
00:34:30.399 only had 17,000 followers, but that was
00:34:32.639 enough to make Zach six figures. or
00:34:35.040 Andrew who made $15,000 in the last 24
00:34:37.599 hours and over $57,000 on the niche
00:34:40.239 topic of sober living homes. Okay, he
00:34:42.800 has $39,000 followers on his Instagram.
00:34:44.960 He's the sort of creator that I am
00:34:46.560 referring to. Okay, now again all these
00:34:48.719 examples are creators who are already
00:34:50.800 monetizing their audiences with a
00:34:52.480 digital product, which is about 1% of
00:34:54.480 all micro creators. Okay, I said 99% of
00:34:57.760 creators, they could be making as much
00:34:59.200 money as the ones I just showed you, but
00:35:00.640 they're missing out. Okay. The thing
00:35:02.079 that they're missing is someone like you
00:35:03.440 to help them put a digital product in
00:35:05.680 place. In the grand scheme of things,
00:35:07.200 microcreators like this are merely a
00:35:09.200 drop in the ocean. According to data
00:35:10.800 from Linkree, there are 41 million of
00:35:13.599 these sort of creators. Okay? And most
00:35:15.839 of them don't even know that they are
00:35:17.200 sitting on a gold mine and you just need
00:35:19.839 one. All right? If you could just get
00:35:21.760 one of them to say yes to you, you could
00:35:23.680 easily launch a digital product to their
00:35:25.599 already existing audience and get a
00:35:27.680 slice of that profit pie. a slice as big
00:35:30.079 as $20,000 for a small creator paid out
00:35:32.400 directly from [ __ ] to your bank account.
00:35:34.720 And you could continue to get paid for
00:35:36.400 as long as the creator keeps promoting
00:35:38.000 this product to their audience. I know
00:35:39.839 creators making $30,000 a month from as
00:35:42.000 few as 5,000 followers. And at a 30%
00:35:44.800 revenue split, which is not uncommon
00:35:46.240 with this strategy, you'd be getting
00:35:47.440 paid 9,000 a month without having to put
00:35:49.680 any without having to put in any
00:35:51.680 additional work without you having to
00:35:53.599 grow an audience from scratch or show
00:35:55.280 your face online just by tapping into
00:35:57.440 the audience that the creator already
00:35:58.880 has. Someone who does this is what I
00:36:01.040 call a AI shadow operator. Now, you
00:36:04.079 might be wondering, what do they
00:36:05.680 actually do? In raw words, they are the
00:36:08.240 operators behind other people's public
00:36:10.000 image. Okay? taking micro creators and
00:36:12.160 simply creating digital products for
00:36:13.680 them to sell to their audience. And they
00:36:15.680 do all of that using AI. The creator's
00:36:18.400 face is on the product while a shadow
00:36:20.079 operator stays entirely in the shadows.
00:36:23.200 Okay? Without any pressure on their
00:36:24.720 shoulders to have their name and
00:36:26.000 reputation attached to the product being
00:36:27.920 sold. If you scroll through WP, you're
00:36:29.680 going to find hundreds of these shadow
00:36:31.040 operators who don't even have a profile
00:36:32.880 picture, but are making tens of
00:36:34.480 thousands of dollars behind the scenes,
00:36:35.920 just like Zach and Kevin here. And as I
00:36:38.000 said, most of these creators had no
00:36:39.920 products to sell despite their followers
00:36:42.240 literally begging to buy something from
00:36:43.920 them. This is a rare case of a market
00:36:46.000 with high demand but zero supply. Think
00:36:48.800 about it. Every other business has to
00:36:50.640 compete for customers. Here customers,
00:36:52.960 okay, their followers are begging to buy
00:36:55.599 and no one is selling. Now, what do you
00:36:58.000 think happens when you enter a market
00:36:59.440 like that and simply give people what
00:37:01.280 they desperately want already? You make
00:37:04.000 a [ __ ] ton of money. Excuse my French.
00:37:06.320 Now, to test this out, I shared a
00:37:08.640 four-step shadow operating strategy with
00:37:10.400 a small group of clients inside of
00:37:12.240 Metize. They would have one
00:37:13.839 conversation, just one, and walk away
00:37:16.000 with instant access to 20, 50, or even
00:37:18.320 100,000 engaged buyers. Then, they would
00:37:20.720 use AI to create a very simple digital
00:37:22.880 product for these creators, and keep 30%
00:37:25.200 of the total revenue that it generated.
00:37:27.760 8 uh 9,000, 15,000, 20,000, even more
00:37:30.480 from a single product with someone
00:37:32.400 else's name and face on it. The creators
00:37:34.720 stayed in the spotlight while our users
00:37:36.800 and our clients stayed in the shadows.
00:37:38.640 Both got rich. We call this the shadow
00:37:40.960 operator method. And once you understand
00:37:42.640 how it works, you will never look at
00:37:44.320 online business the same way again.
00:37:45.839 Because while everyone else is fighting
00:37:47.440 for customers, these shadow operators
00:37:49.839 are quietly banking more than the big
00:37:52.000 influencers that everyone is watching.
00:37:53.920 In fact, there's a large chance that
00:37:55.760 your favorite creators who you know are
00:37:57.520 making lots of money have a shadow
00:37:59.200 operator. You just simply never knew
00:38:00.720 about it. It is very rare for a creator
00:38:02.720 to make money without a shadow operator.
00:38:04.800 Just like an athlete, movie star, or
00:38:06.480 musician is very likely to not have an
00:38:08.480 agent. So, do you want me to break down
00:38:10.960 to you the four-step method on how to
00:38:12.960 close your first creator partnership and
00:38:15.040 launch a product to their audience with
00:38:17.040 the potential to make multiple five
00:38:18.640 figures in sales? Let me know if that's
00:38:20.320 something you guys want me to share. Let
00:38:21.839 me uh uh And by the way, guys, if that
00:38:23.920 is something you want me to share, drop
00:38:25.520 a shadow operator in the chat. Yes, let
00:38:28.400 me see a bunch of shadow operators and
00:38:29.760 we'll get into it. Uh any improvement?
00:38:32.079 >> Yeah, much better.
00:38:32.880 >> Much better.
00:38:35.440 >> Also, let me know guys, drop a shadow
00:38:37.119 operator and let me know is has there
00:38:38.320 been any improvement in the video? Audio
00:38:40.240 I know is all good. And uh we'll go from
00:38:42.320 there. And guys, once again, just
00:38:43.359 remember you have to be here live uh in
00:38:45.760 order to get all of the goodies at the
00:38:47.760 end. Shadow operator. Shadow operator.
00:38:49.839 Shadow operator. Love it. Shadow
00:38:52.000 operator. Hashtag shadow operator. Love
00:38:54.720 it. Seems like you guys are super super
00:38:56.160 excited. Beautiful. Beautiful.
00:38:59.760 Beautiful. Beautiful. Yeah, guys, let
00:39:01.040 just uh just let me know. Someone said
00:39:02.960 smooth operator. I love that. Um let me
00:39:06.720 know if uh audio is all good, video is
00:39:09.440 all good. Awesome. Audio live is good.
00:39:13.839 Beautiful. Beautiful.
00:39:17.200 All right. Cool. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
00:39:19.839 Yes. So, it's all good now. Yep. All
00:39:23.200 right. Beautiful. Well, in that case, we
00:39:25.359 can get back into it.
00:39:29.520 With that being said,
00:39:31.760 uh let's get into it. Okay, process is
00:39:33.440 simple just like all beautiful things in
00:39:35.440 life. Number one, you are going to find
00:39:37.520 creators that you can easily partner
00:39:38.960 with and monetize their audience with a
00:39:40.720 digital product for a slice of the
00:39:42.160 profits. Number two, you're going to
00:39:43.839 reach out to these creators showing that
00:39:45.440 you can help them. Hint hint, by
00:39:47.119 actually helping them. And this is where
00:39:48.560 we really start taking advantage of AI.
00:39:50.320 And I'm going to show you how to do that
00:39:51.280 in just a second. Number three, you're
00:39:52.960 going to help them develop a simple
00:39:54.240 digital product using the content that
00:39:55.920 they already have. So that way you don't
00:39:57.520 have to create anything yourself.
00:39:59.760 And then number four, that's going to be
00:40:02.000 promoted to their audience using a
00:40:03.520 proven strategy that any beginner can
00:40:05.440 execute in 14 days with just a few
00:40:08.079 Instagram stories, especially with the
00:40:10.160 help of AI. My favorite thing about this
00:40:11.920 process is this. It removes all the
00:40:13.920 risk. You only partner with creators you
00:40:16.000 know will be profitable, who have
00:40:17.520 pre-existing audiences you can sell to.
00:40:19.680 You don't ever need to worry about where
00:40:21.119 the sales are going to come from because
00:40:22.880 the creator already built a buyer
00:40:24.720 audience for you. At no point in this
00:40:26.720 process will you need to risk any money.
00:40:29.040 And you can and by the way guys, you can
00:40:30.880 know how to do this almost down to the
00:40:32.480 penny, okay? Uh with the digital
00:40:34.400 product. And I'm going to show you
00:40:35.280 actually how to calculate this with the
00:40:36.560 profit calculator. If you compare this
00:40:38.400 to other models that show you how to
00:40:39.680 make money online, many of them are hard
00:40:41.680 to tell if they will work. And most
00:40:43.040 often they don't work for those that try
00:40:44.800 them, no matter how hard they try. Here,
00:40:47.200 sales are almost guaranteed because the
00:40:49.119 audience is already there. Okay? It's
00:40:50.880 the exact same reason I've managed to do
00:40:52.960 well for myself because I have a loyal
00:40:54.800 audience. And with the shadow operator
00:40:56.720 method, you get the same competitive
00:40:58.560 advantage without spending years and
00:41:00.480 years trying to build this audience
00:41:01.760 yourself. So with that being said, let's
00:41:04.240 get into the steps. Do you mind if I go
00:41:06.560 a bit technical here for a second? Let
00:41:08.240 me know in the chat if you guys mind if
00:41:10.319 we get a little technical here on out.
00:41:12.400 Okay, I assure you, okay, you will have
00:41:15.359 to learn some details and it may feel a
00:41:17.280 little overwhelming at first, but if you
00:41:19.040 can just work your way through it, I
00:41:20.720 guarantee you the riches are on the
00:41:23.119 other side. So, just let me know in the
00:41:24.640 chat if you guys are all cool, if you go
00:41:26.319 get a little technical for just a hot
00:41:28.240 sec. And uh yes, yes, yes, 100%. Hell
00:41:31.280 yeah. Okay. Hash shadow operator.
00:41:33.520 Hashtag shadow operator. Interested?
00:41:35.520 Cool. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, cool. Seems
00:41:36.960 like you guys are fine with that. Look,
00:41:39.119 the benefits from what you'll get from
00:41:40.640 today's session will come from enduring
00:41:42.079 the pain of overwhelm. Okay? The lazy
00:41:44.480 people who cannot handle a little
00:41:45.839 discomfort. Unfortunately, I have
00:41:47.280 nothing to say except you're going to be
00:41:48.800 stuck. Okay? I'm in this presentation
00:41:51.520 and over our 5 days together, I'm not
00:41:53.200 going to try to like make you feel warm
00:41:54.800 and cozy and fuzzy and try to sell you
00:41:56.560 lies of what's possible and what's not
00:41:58.240 possible and like like this will involve
00:42:00.000 work. Okay? Now, you can make it 99
00:42:02.079 times easier if you go for a done for
00:42:05.040 you solution, but if you're going to do
00:42:06.079 it yourself, it's going to take time and
00:42:07.280 effort. That's just the case. Okay. So,
00:42:09.839 are you in with me here for a technical
00:42:11.599 part? Even if it takes a little bit of
00:42:12.880 work. Seems like you guys are. Cool. So,
00:42:15.680 now that we agreed to get technical
00:42:17.040 here, the first thing you need to
00:42:18.160 understand is this. You should never
00:42:19.839 shadow operate a creator without first
00:42:21.680 knowing how much money you can make from
00:42:23.040 their audience. With a basic math
00:42:24.720 equation and one resource, you can
00:42:26.640 figure this out. Okay? In a matter of
00:42:28.240 minutes, you can know how. Okay? Uh or
00:42:30.480 sorry, in a matter of minutes, once you
00:42:32.319 know how, you can look at a creator and
00:42:34.319 know their profit potential. And do not
00:42:36.400 worry about having to do the math here.
00:42:37.839 Once again, in today's workbook, I'm
00:42:39.359 going to give you a calculator. So that
00:42:40.880 way, all you need to do is input the
00:42:42.880 numbers and it will do all of the work
00:42:44.319 for you. So, here's how we do this. The
00:42:46.960 first thing we need to do is know the
00:42:48.640 price of this digital product. And
00:42:49.839 that's super easy. You can basically
00:42:51.200 pick any price you want. My
00:42:52.800 recommendation is anywhere from $150 to
00:42:55.280 $300. Yes, I want you to understand this
00:42:57.440 is slightly higher, okay, than normal
00:42:59.839 when it comes to pricing. That's because
00:43:01.520 the creator already has an audience
00:43:03.280 expertise and demand, okay? They have
00:43:05.200 every single competitive advantage. So
00:43:06.880 because they have an audience expertise
00:43:08.640 and demand, okay, it is easier to
00:43:10.880 command a higher price, which means that
00:43:12.800 you can make a lot more money sooner.
00:43:15.119 Okay, so $150 to $300, you cannot go
00:43:18.240 wrong with that. It works for any
00:43:19.760 industry. So now that we know the price,
00:43:22.319 the next part of the formula is the
00:43:23.839 number of followers. Okay, and that you
00:43:25.760 can easily find out just by looking at
00:43:27.280 their profile. For example, how many
00:43:29.040 followers does this creator have?
00:43:30.640 14,300. Okay, what about this one?
00:43:32.720 52,000. So that's super uh easy to get.
00:43:36.400 Okay. Now the next metric we need to
00:43:39.200 look at for our formula here is
00:43:40.480 engagement. Engagement basically
00:43:42.720 represents that small percentage of
00:43:44.400 people who are true fans of this
00:43:46.560 creator. Those people who like
00:43:48.240 everything the creator posts. They watch
00:43:49.839 all their videos. They comment on
00:43:51.200 everything they do. And that's usually a
00:43:53.200 very small percentage of their audience.
00:43:54.960 Okay. when they have a big audience
00:43:56.880 anywhere from zero to five 0.5% to 5% of
00:44:00.720 their entire audience only 0.5 to 5%
00:44:03.599 will be true fans okay those are the
00:44:05.839 followers with real buying potential
00:44:08.319 that small percentage of people who are
00:44:10.240 emotionally invested in this creator now
00:44:12.800 why is it important to consider this in
00:44:14.480 our equation rather than just taking
00:44:16.319 their total amount of followers because
00:44:18.319 everything I teach you here is is based
00:44:20.800 on what is realistic okay so let me ask
00:44:23.359 you a
00:44:25.280 And actually I like please answer. Is it
00:44:27.520 realistic for us to assume like if we're
00:44:29.680 being responsible individuals, okay, and
00:44:32.079 if I'm here trying to actually help you
00:44:34.000 in 2026 move forward, is it realistic
00:44:36.640 for us to assume that every single one
00:44:38.480 of their followers is a potential buyer?
00:44:40.240 Let me know. Is that realistic? Would
00:44:41.760 you trust me if I sat here and went,
00:44:43.280 &quot;Okay, well, they have uh uh 30,000
00:44:46.640 followers, and from their 30,000
00:44:48.079 followers, we're going to take a large
00:44:49.599 percentage, and all of those 30,000
00:44:51.520 people are potential buyers and are
00:44:53.440 going to want to buy something.&quot; No,
00:44:54.640 that's not realistic. Okay? So, I'm not
00:44:56.400 going to try to I'm not going to try to
00:44:58.400 help you and guide you for 2026. And I'm
00:45:00.880 not going to uh even from your side, you
00:45:03.599 shouldn't work on a business model and
00:45:05.119 move forward with something on the
00:45:06.640 assumption and taking the best numbers
00:45:08.560 possible. Okay? We're going to look at
00:45:09.680 the worst case scenario. Let's look at
00:45:10.960 the worst case scenario and if it still
00:45:12.640 makes sense then we do it. Okay. So look
00:45:16.319 probably quite uh you pro or I should
00:45:18.319 say you probably follow quite a few of
00:45:19.680 these creators yourself. Maybe that's
00:45:20.880 fitness creators, finance or any other
00:45:22.640 hobby that you have. Now does that mean
00:45:24.400 that all of the people that you follow
00:45:26.160 you would buy something from every
00:45:27.599 single one of them? Of course not. Okay.
00:45:29.680 Now there's probably one or two creators
00:45:31.520 that you follow where you watch
00:45:32.640 everything they post. Okay. You love
00:45:33.920 their stuff. Okay. So you you basically
00:45:35.760 watch all their videos. You love their
00:45:37.520 content. Okay. I'm sure. Do you guys
00:45:38.960 have anyone that comes to mind? Are
00:45:40.079 there like one or two people, you know,
00:45:41.280 these small micro creators where you're
00:45:42.720 like, damn, I really, excuse my French,
00:45:44.560 I really [ __ ] with their stuff. Like, I
00:45:46.000 love their stuff and like I really
00:45:47.520 appreciate them and I just have this
00:45:48.640 kind of connection with them and these
00:45:50.000 are the sort of people that you would
00:45:51.200 buy something in an instant. Okay. Now,
00:45:54.800 if they ever offered something to buy,
00:45:56.480 okay, and if it was the right product,
00:45:58.240 would it be out of this world to say
00:46:00.000 that you would potentially buy? Guys,
00:46:01.280 drop in the chat if you follow some of
00:46:02.960 these micro creators, okay? people from
00:46:04.640 10,000 to 100,000 followers if they drop
00:46:06.720 something right and it was the right
00:46:08.240 price point and you're like you know
00:46:09.359 what I really mess with this like this I
00:46:11.440 feel like this is really speaking to me
00:46:13.040 would it be out of this world you know
00:46:14.640 like I'm not talking about the thousand
00:46:16.720 people that you follow I'm talking about
00:46:17.920 like you know those those those two or
00:46:19.520 three creators where you're like I
00:46:20.640 really really mess with their stuff okay
00:46:22.400 would it be out of this world for you to
00:46:23.760 buy something from them let me know in
00:46:25.280 the chat
00:46:29.040 no no yes I would buy 100%
00:46:34.480 Yes, I might buy
00:46:36.960 now. Would probably buy it. So, what I'm
00:46:38.960 saying would it be out of the world? I
00:46:40.160 think you guys are saying no to
00:46:41.280 basically say yes. So, so basically you
00:46:43.040 guys are all saying yes. Um, amazing,
00:46:45.359 amazing, amazing. Yes, why not? Okay,
00:46:47.359 cool. Right. Well, that basically proves
00:46:49.440 this model. You you guys yourself have
00:46:51.280 now literally just proved this model.
00:46:52.960 The point is that there are these people
00:46:54.960 that have the audience. They've done all
00:46:57.200 of the hard work. Okay, they are sitting
00:46:59.040 on this gold mine. and they just don't
00:47:00.319 know how to extract that gold. Okay,
00:47:04.079 so that is what we're counting on here,
00:47:05.920 okay? That a very small percentage of
00:47:07.440 their audience would be potential
00:47:08.720 buyers. Here, we're going to assume that
00:47:10.720 at least 95% of their audience are just
00:47:12.640 followers. Okay, a follower is not a
00:47:14.480 true fan. Okay, and and that 95% of
00:47:17.040 their audience will never buy anything
00:47:18.640 from them. Okay, can you drop in the
00:47:20.800 chat if you think that sounds a little
00:47:22.240 bit more realistic than assuming that
00:47:23.920 every single one of their followers is a
00:47:25.359 potential buyer? Do you think now that
00:47:27.040 you think about it, these micro
00:47:28.400 creators, do you think it's fair enough
00:47:29.839 to assume that 5% of their audience is
00:47:31.839 like, &quot;Yeah, doesn't mean that they
00:47:33.680 would, but they're like,&quot;Yeah, you know,
00:47:35.280 I I I would consider or I would I I
00:47:37.599 would be open to it. I would strongly
00:47:38.880 consider buying something.&quot; Okay, does
00:47:40.880 that sound a little bit more realistic
00:47:42.000 to you? Great. Well, here's how we
00:47:45.040 actually measure engagement. Okay. Based
00:47:46.560 on the most recent studies on influencer
00:47:48.319 marketing, micro influencers with 3 to
00:47:50.160 5% engagement are considered to have
00:47:52.240 strong loyal audiences. Micro creators
00:47:54.079 are actually the best sort of creators
00:47:55.839 to work with. Okay, above 5% is
00:47:58.400 considered exceptional. From 1 to 3% is
00:48:00.400 medium and anything below 1% is low.
00:48:03.119 Okay, here's a table to make it super
00:48:05.280 easy to uh visualize. Now, you might be
00:48:07.280 wondering, how do we actually figure out
00:48:08.640 engagement? For that, we use a very
00:48:10.400 simple free tool called SocialBlade. You
00:48:13.040 just put the Instagram handle of the
00:48:14.319 creator you're doing this calculation
00:48:15.680 for, and then SocialBlade will literally
00:48:17.440 just tell you their engagement. And with
00:48:18.960 this, our engagement number is added to
00:48:21.119 our equation. So the last number for us
00:48:23.200 to figure out is the conversion rate.
00:48:24.960 And conversion rate is very simple,
00:48:26.720 okay? It basically means out of their
00:48:28.240 true fans, how many are actually going
00:48:30.079 to buy when you offer them something.
00:48:31.359 And by the way, that doesn't mean buy on
00:48:32.559 day one. It means over the space of a
00:48:34.400 few days or a few weeks or whatever it
00:48:35.760 may be, okay? Because obviously, as I
00:48:37.599 said, not every one of the creators true
00:48:39.440 fans is going to buy every time. Now,
00:48:41.920 based on hundreds of thousands of
00:48:44.000 transactions that I oversee every single
00:48:46.079 month on [ __ ] I can tell you that on
00:48:48.000 average for a microcreator specifically,
00:48:50.480 around 40% of their true fans will buy.
00:48:53.040 So, out of that small percentage of true
00:48:55.680 fans that we talked about, around 40% of
00:48:58.319 them will eventually buy. Okay? Just you
00:49:00.079 understand what this means in practice.
00:49:01.680 So, if someone has 10,000 followers and
00:49:04.079 we take an engagement rate of 3%, which
00:49:05.839 by the way is average, that's not
00:49:07.119 exceptional. at a 40% conversion rate of
00:49:09.920 true fans to buyers. It means that we
00:49:12.000 are counting on 98.8% of this creator's
00:49:15.200 followers to ignore their offer. Okay?
00:49:17.520 So, I'm not giving you a situation here
00:49:19.119 where I say, &quot;Oh, well, if half of their
00:49:21.119 audience buys the product, no, no, no,
00:49:22.880 guys, that's unrealistic.&quot; Okay? That's
00:49:24.800 irrational. I'm giving you guys, as I
00:49:26.400 said, I'm keeping it no [ __ ] I'm
00:49:27.839 keeping it straight up with you guys.
00:49:29.200 I'm giving you a situation where
00:49:31.040 literally 98.8% of their audience
00:49:33.680 completely ignores the product. And we
00:49:35.920 are counting on that to happen because
00:49:37.839 here we are planning for the worst. This
00:49:39.760 is why, as I said, this is the most
00:49:41.280 truthful and non-bullshit training you
00:49:43.599 will see this entire year. I'm keeping
00:49:45.280 it so straight up with you guys. Okay,
00:49:47.440 once again, please drop something in the
00:49:48.960 chat. If look, you guys actually
00:49:50.480 appreciate the honesty in showing you
00:49:52.079 examples that are actually realistic
00:49:54.000 here. Do you guys appreciate the fact
00:49:55.200 that I'm showing you guys the worst case
00:49:57.040 scenario, the worst situation? And if
00:49:58.960 the worst case scenario and the worst
00:50:00.480 situation makes sense, then it's like,
00:50:02.240 okay, cool. We have something to work
00:50:03.520 with. We're not relying on hope that,
00:50:05.680 oh, maybe if the best case situation
00:50:07.520 works out. I'm showing you the worst
00:50:09.040 numbers and then we're working uh uh the
00:50:11.200 other way from there. If it goes, you
00:50:12.800 know, if we have our expectations set at
00:50:15.200 the worst case scenario and it uh uh we
00:50:17.680 overachieve from that, well then great.
00:50:19.359 You know, everyone loves a good
00:50:20.400 surprise. Um so, let me just go ahead
00:50:22.720 and check the chat. Yes, yes, yes, yes.
00:50:26.480 Uh well, good. I'm glad that you guys
00:50:28.480 appreciate it. Um first things first, I
00:50:31.200 just want to give a shout out to all you
00:50:32.400 guys. Um because the you know for the
00:50:34.640 77,000 that are here I believe at one
00:50:36.319 point it went up to 85,000 or 86,000. Uh
00:50:39.520 for the 77,000 that are here I just want
00:50:41.200 to take literally 30 seconds just to
00:50:42.720 give you a [ __ ] shout out and
00:50:44.000 literally you know just let you know
00:50:45.200 that I appreciate you guys. I respect
00:50:47.040 you guys. I love you guys and I love the
00:50:49.760 fact that I can be straight up with you
00:50:51.119 cuz I'm going to be honest. There's a
00:50:52.400 lot of times where I'm doing a
00:50:54.400 presentation I can't be honest. So I was
00:50:56.720 really scared that when I said like oh
00:50:58.240 do you guys appreciate the honesty? Some
00:50:59.520 of you guys will be like no or this
00:51:00.960 freaks me out or oh this is too much or
00:51:03.680 whatever. So like I just wanted to
00:51:06.160 basically acknowledge you guys for a
00:51:07.599 second and let you know that I really
00:51:10.000 appreciate and respect the fact that I
00:51:11.680 can be so straight up and I can be so
00:51:13.839 straightforward with you guys. So um
00:51:15.680 yeah, I love that you guys are amazing
00:51:17.599 audience to uh to speak to today. So
00:51:19.920 that's uh incredible. So now with all
00:51:23.200 these numbers, we can plug them into the
00:51:24.720 calculator to have our final profit
00:51:26.400 potential. Okay, at a 250 price point, 9
00:51:29.520 uh 98,000 followers and a 1.22%
00:51:32.240 engagement rate, okay, which is far
00:51:33.760 below average, you would have a profit
00:51:35.599 potential of $119,000. Your 30% cut of
00:51:38.880 that, you walk away with $35,000 profit
00:51:41.839 in your pocket. Now, as you can see, not
00:51:44.559 every creator will have the same profit
00:51:46.000 potential. This creator is in the
00:51:47.760 familyhood space, okay? They have a
00:51:49.440 22,000 potential with only 14,000
00:51:51.920 followers.
00:51:54.079 And this one right here in the finance
00:51:55.520 space, it's $47,000 potential. Do you
00:51:57.760 notice how the engagement rate makes a
00:51:59.440 huge difference here? Okay, same amount
00:52:01.200 of followers as the last one, double the
00:52:03.200 profit potential. This creator in the
00:52:05.040 parenthood space, $76,000 profit
00:52:07.359 potential. At a 30% cut, you walk away
00:52:09.359 with almost $23,000. So my question to
00:52:12.319 you is, how much would an extra $23,000
00:52:14.880 benefit your life? Again, I am not
00:52:16.960 saying that you're going to become a
00:52:17.920 millionaire overnight or anything. We
00:52:19.359 are being realistic here. If you came to
00:52:21.680 this training and you're like, I want to
00:52:23.280 watch this and within one month I want
00:52:24.720 to be a millionaire, go away. I'm I'm
00:52:27.280 trying to say this in the most
00:52:28.079 respectful and polite way possible.
00:52:29.599 Please go away, okay? Because I I can't
00:52:31.599 give you those lies or these these
00:52:34.480 false, you know, promises, like it's
00:52:36.319 just not realistic, okay? But if you see
00:52:38.559 this equation and you're like, &quot;Okay, an
00:52:40.160 extra $23,000 could definitely benefit
00:52:41.920 me in my life right now.&quot; Then keep
00:52:44.559 watching this training, okay? And look,
00:52:47.359 I'm giving you these numbers. Everything
00:52:48.800 I just showed you right here, it still
00:52:50.800 works even if 98.8% of the creators
00:52:53.920 followers completely ignore the offer
00:52:56.240 and completely ignore the product. Okay.
00:52:58.079 So, with that number, would you be
00:52:59.440 willing to give it a shot? You see, the
00:53:01.119 beauty of this meth methodology is that
00:53:03.119 we actually factor in it's hardcoded
00:53:05.119 that we think or we understand or we
00:53:07.200 know that most people are not going to
00:53:08.960 do what we want them to do. Okay? What
00:53:10.960 other methodology teaches you that? And
00:53:12.640 remember our rule of one. All it takes
00:53:14.880 uh to get this type of result is one yes
00:53:16.559 to a partnership using the four-step
00:53:18.160 method. So now that you understand how
00:53:20.319 to actually calculate your profit
00:53:21.920 potential, let me show you how to
00:53:23.200 actually find these creators that we
00:53:24.559 keep talking about. What you're going to
00:53:25.920 do is you're going to open your
00:53:26.960 Instagram app. Okay? If you don't have
00:53:28.319 it, download it. Create a dummy account.
00:53:30.400 Instagram will be a central piece of
00:53:32.319 what it is that we are doing here. Now,
00:53:34.800 you're going to go into the explore page
00:53:36.319 and we're going to search for potential
00:53:37.599 creators to partner with. How? By typing
00:53:40.079 industry plus a keyword that creators
00:53:41.839 often use in their content. For example,
00:53:43.920 the industry could be parenting. And an
00:53:45.839 easy keyword to add here that creators
00:53:47.599 often use in their content is the word
00:53:49.520 tips. Okay? So, in this example, you
00:53:51.359 would just search parenting tips. Then,
00:53:53.760 what we do here is we're going to start
00:53:55.359 scroll scrolling through the results.
00:53:57.280 Here, I like to scroll through the most
00:53:58.880 viewed ones and try to find ones with
00:54:00.800 viewer uh fewer than 200,000 views.
00:54:03.280 Ideally, between 50 to 200,000 views,
00:54:05.599 okay? Because remember, we are targeting
00:54:08.640 micro creators here, not creators with
00:54:10.640 millions of followers. Okay? That is a
00:54:12.880 very key part of the process. If I did
00:54:14.880 this presentation and I told you to go
00:54:16.720 to creators with millions of followers,
00:54:18.400 that's just unrealistic. Okay? And I'll
00:54:19.920 be honest, you're not going to have any
00:54:21.040 success. Now, after doing this for 2, 3,
00:54:23.520 4, 5 years, you'll probably have a lot
00:54:24.960 of success, but not on day one. Okay?
00:54:26.800 So, I have to give you a realistic game
00:54:28.319 plan here. Okay? All we need to do is we
00:54:30.880 need to find one good creator here and
00:54:32.559 Instagram will do the rest of the work
00:54:34.079 for us. So, once you find one of the
00:54:36.079 results that match our criteria, you
00:54:37.520 click on it and you go to the profile of
00:54:39.119 that creator. If it's between 10 to
00:54:41.040 100,000 followers, that is the sweet
00:54:42.960 spot we're looking for. In this example,
00:54:44.720 I found this account. Of course, I'm
00:54:46.079 blurring out handles and names out of
00:54:47.760 respect for their privacy. But you get
00:54:49.440 the idea. 61,000 followers. That is
00:54:51.920 perfect. Now, I can also see that she's
00:54:54.079 getting a good number of views on her
00:54:55.599 account, meaning her followers actually
00:54:57.200 consume what it is that she posts. And
00:55:00.000 that is what drives that engagement up
00:55:01.920 that we talked about a few minutes ago.
00:55:03.280 So far, so good. Okay, everyone
00:55:04.720 following? You guys all understand? All
00:55:06.400 right. So, there's one final sign here
00:55:08.800 that makes this creator a perfect fit,
00:55:10.559 and this is a pro tip to find creators
00:55:12.319 with high monetization potential. What
00:55:14.240 you are looking for here are profiles
00:55:16.000 with either a contact email on their bio
00:55:18.720 or any mention of collab. This is very
00:55:21.440 important, guys. Okay, what we are
00:55:22.800 looking for is any sort of contact email
00:55:25.440 on their bio or any sort of mention or
00:55:27.440 email for collaborations. Okay, this is
00:55:30.640 the secret. Okay, if they have email for
00:55:32.960 collabs or business inquiries in their
00:55:35.040 bio, they probably have dozens of
00:55:37.119 thousands of followers of uh um sorry,
00:55:39.680 dozens of thousands of dollars of
00:55:41.200 untapped profit potential inside of
00:55:43.200 their audience. Why? Because if they
00:55:45.760 have that email there, it means that
00:55:47.200 they don't have their own product to
00:55:48.480 sell. Okay? They are surviving on brand
00:55:51.280 collaborations and sponsorships, which
00:55:53.359 are unreliable sources of income and pay
00:55:55.839 very little. It's what I call hope
00:55:58.240 marketing. They're hoping some brand
00:55:59.680 will come across their profile and throw
00:56:01.359 them $500 for a post. It's not a very
00:56:03.599 sustainable strategy to base your income
00:56:05.200 on, right? Waiting for someone to
00:56:06.880 message you saying, &quot;Hey, I want to give
00:56:08.240 you money.&quot; But here's the beautiful
00:56:09.760 part for you. If they have their email
00:56:11.440 there, they are expecting you to them
00:56:13.520 contact them about potential
00:56:15.440 partnerships. They are literally
00:56:16.960 advertising that they are open for
00:56:18.400 business opportunities. So, when you
00:56:19.599 reach out about your shadow operating
00:56:21.200 proposal, they're going to be very
00:56:22.720 receptive. You are not cold messaging
00:56:24.400 someone random. you are not respond uh
00:56:26.240 but instead I should say you're
00:56:27.760 responding to their invitation to
00:56:29.440 discuss business deals. It's basically
00:56:32.000 like they have a sign, okay, saying help
00:56:34.160 wanted without even knowing it. Okay, so
00:56:36.240 if they have a contact email there,
00:56:38.000 that's a great sign. Okay, all you need
00:56:40.319 to do here is find one creator with
00:56:42.720 these criteria because once you find
00:56:44.720 one, here's a secret trick that you can
00:56:46.640 apply to find dozens and dozens of
00:56:48.240 accounts similar to that one. All you
00:56:50.400 need to do is click on the small button
00:56:52.079 with an icon of a person and a plus
00:56:53.760 sign. Okay, right next to the messages
00:56:55.359 button, that's what it looks like. When
00:56:56.640 you click that, Instagram will show you
00:56:58.079 dozens of similar accounts to the one
00:57:00.079 that you just found. Okay, and you can
00:57:02.400 just keep clicking on these accounts.
00:57:03.839 Okay, and you can keep going and then
00:57:05.920 you keep going from the recommended as
00:57:07.599 well. Okay, so for example, from that
00:57:09.440 seed account, I found this account and
00:57:11.839 this account and this other account and
00:57:13.680 you can basically keep doing this
00:57:14.799 forever and I will and from that you're
00:57:16.480 going to find dozens and dozens of good
00:57:18.160 accounts. It's like finding the first
00:57:19.920 thread. Once you pull it, everything
00:57:21.680 else starts to unravel. And then you can
00:57:23.760 repeat the same process with different
00:57:25.440 keywords in your search to find creators
00:57:27.760 across all different niches. Think solo
00:57:30.160 travel, luxury travel, clean beauty,
00:57:31.839 anti-aging, men's grooming, yoga, home
00:57:33.760 workouts, wellness, vegan cooking, home
00:57:35.440 booking, uh sorry, home baking, uh just
00:57:38.480 to name a few. Now, once again, to make
00:57:41.040 your life easier, so that way you don't
00:57:42.319 have to think about all these different
00:57:43.359 topics yourself, I've put together a
00:57:45.359 list of 200 plus topics that you can
00:57:47.119 search for creators on. This will come
00:57:48.880 inside of the digital workbook uh that
00:57:51.119 you guys will get at the end of the
00:57:52.319 session with the password. I said at the
00:57:54.400 end of our live session, I'm going to
00:57:55.520 give you the password for the workbook
00:57:57.280 uh and the link to get it. Now, in
00:57:59.200 today's workbook, you're going to find
00:58:00.319 that list and the entire action plan to
00:58:02.160 execute the four-step process. Now,
00:58:04.240 here's what's going to separate those
00:58:05.520 who are successful with this formula
00:58:06.880 from those who are not. To shadow
00:58:08.720 operate for creators like this, you're
00:58:10.480 going to have to reach out to them. And
00:58:11.920 many of us were raised as kids to
00:58:13.760 believe that we shouldn't talk to
00:58:15.040 strangers. And here we are, full-g grown
00:58:16.960 adults, and we still think we're not
00:58:18.640 supposed to talk to strangers. Here is
00:58:20.400 the type of self-sabotage talk that's
00:58:22.559 going to keep people from making big
00:58:24.240 profits with this model. Here, okay,
00:58:27.359 people say to themselves, &quot;Well, I'm new
00:58:29.200 to this. Why would a creator ever want
00:58:30.640 to partner up with me?&quot; And here is
00:58:32.799 where you decide if you want to be right
00:58:34.559 or you want to be rich. Okay? Because
00:58:36.160 the truth is, they do. The creators do
00:58:38.720 want to partner up with someone exactly
00:58:40.319 like you. At least enough of them to
00:58:42.160 make this work. And by the way, if you
00:58:43.359 don't believe me, just take a look at at
00:58:45.119 this message I received a few weeks ago.
00:58:47.119 Hi Eman, could you please put me in
00:58:48.559 touch with some AI shadow operators? I'm
00:58:50.480 a creator with 100,000 followers
00:58:52.079 teaching reality trans surfing and inner
00:58:53.839 healing. I'm confident that we can scale
00:58:55.760 to 1 million in online courses, which by
00:58:57.520 the way is one form of a digital
00:58:58.960 product. After seeing your shadow
00:59:00.640 operator method, I realized that I was
00:59:02.559 the perfect creator to create a
00:59:03.760 partnership with. Okay, look, it's
00:59:05.920 literally right in front. I receive
00:59:07.040 messages like this all the time. Okay,
00:59:09.119 that's only one of the messages. I
00:59:11.280 received dozens and dozens of these a
00:59:12.799 week. Okay, check this one out. This is
00:59:14.880 from a creator who has 148,000
00:59:16.799 followers. They say that they are
00:59:18.400 struggling with monetization and would
00:59:20.079 like to partner with someone to help
00:59:21.520 them build uh their digital ecosystem.
00:59:23.520 Or check out what this creator in the
00:59:24.960 high ticket sales niche is saying. I
00:59:26.559 just want to focus on content, not any
00:59:28.400 of the backend stuff, which is the exact
00:59:30.640 problem that I've been telling you that
00:59:32.160 all these creators face. Or this other
00:59:33.920 one with 25,000 followers who is asking
00:59:36.079 me to put them in touch with an AI
00:59:38.079 shadow operator. He is saying that he
00:59:39.920 can confidently scale to $200,000. Or
00:59:42.400 this creator who talks about Italy, they
00:59:44.559 have 140,000 followers, but they just
00:59:46.400 don't know how to monetize their
00:59:47.599 audience. Look, these are just literally
00:59:50.000 just a few a few messages that a few of
00:59:52.720 dozens and dozens of messages I receive
00:59:54.480 a week. Do you understand how these
00:59:56.559 microcreators are already actively
00:59:58.400 looking for people just like you? Look,
01:00:00.880 back in my agency days, I got thousands
01:00:03.119 and thousands and thousands of people to
01:00:04.799 reach out to CEOs and founders and
01:00:06.480 propose to them to pay 2,000, 3,000,
01:00:08.960 5,000, even 10,000 a month for marketing
01:00:11.440 services. And the ones who decided that
01:00:13.599 they wanted to be rich rather than right
01:00:16.000 made tons of money from it. Okay? They
01:00:17.920 were brand new to business. Lots of them
01:00:19.520 even consider themselves too old to get
01:00:21.760 into online business. Do you think that
01:00:23.760 these people did something magical or
01:00:25.839 special that you can't do yourself? No,
01:00:28.000 they didn't. The reality is that if you
01:00:30.079 ask enough creators, sooner or later you
01:00:31.920 will get a yes. Plus, on top of that, I
01:00:33.920 know that reaching out to someone with
01:00:35.200 30,000, 40,000, 50,000 followers may
01:00:37.440 seem intimidating, but the reality is
01:00:39.280 most of these creators are just regular
01:00:40.960 people who still work regular jobs.
01:00:43.359 Guys, I want you to think about how many
01:00:45.119 people do you know, okay, with 30,000,
01:00:47.280 40,000, 50,000 followers. That's not a
01:00:49.520 lot of audience, okay? That's not a lot
01:00:51.040 of people to have. Most of these people
01:00:53.839 are creating content, okay, about their
01:00:55.760 hobbies. They have a hobby. They have a
01:00:57.040 thing they're into. That's why they have
01:00:58.240 this the audience in the first place.
01:00:59.520 Okay, they're talking about their
01:01:01.200 favorite cologn, their cologne uh uh
01:01:04.160 micro influencers. Okay, they love that
01:01:06.079 thing more than anything. If they could
01:01:07.200 make it a full-time job, they would. But
01:01:08.799 unfortunately, they spend their time,
01:01:10.000 okay? They're passionate. They love
01:01:11.280 building an audience speaking about
01:01:12.400 cologn or speaking about gardening, but
01:01:14.319 then they have to go to their real job,
01:01:16.079 okay? That is where you come in, okay?
01:01:18.400 And that's why this is such an
01:01:19.599 opportunity. And what's so cool about
01:01:21.119 this, okay, is I'll be honest with you,
01:01:23.599 it is actually hard to go to a business
01:01:25.280 owner when you're a beginner and go,
01:01:27.839 &quot;Listen, you're already doing marketing,
01:01:30.079 so you're already a 6 out of 10, okay?
01:01:32.400 And you should pay me $3,000 a month to
01:01:35.440 take you from a 6 out of 10 to an 8 out
01:01:36.960 of 10. But if you go to someone who's a
01:01:40.240 zero out of 10, and these people are
01:01:41.680 zero out of 10 because they have the
01:01:43.760 audience, but they're not making money
01:01:45.040 with this. So because they're not making
01:01:46.720 money with this, they are right now
01:01:49.280 they're they're a 0 out of 10. Their
01:01:50.880 operation is rated at a zero out of 10.
01:01:53.520 Even if you do a 4 out of 10
01:01:55.119 performance, four out of 10 is still
01:01:56.960 more money than they were making doing
01:01:58.480 nothing. Okay? So now you're not
01:02:00.480 selling. Instead, you're actually
01:02:02.000 presenting an opportunity. Okay?
01:02:05.200 Now, if you go back to the example
01:02:06.559 creator I showed you just a few minutes
01:02:07.839 ago, you can see in her bio that she's
01:02:09.280 actually a nurse. Okay? So she's
01:02:10.480 probably making5 to $7,000 a month
01:02:12.480 working a full-time job. and then on top
01:02:14.319 of that having to take care of all the
01:02:16.480 responsibilities that come with being a
01:02:18.319 creator all while getting little to no
01:02:20.160 financial return out of it. Okay, so
01:02:23.040 these people are desperate to get out of
01:02:24.799 their situation. They just don't know
01:02:26.160 how. But after watching today's session,
01:02:28.640 you will know how and then you they will
01:02:31.119 have a very good reason to take you
01:02:32.559 seriously. Now, here is what I used to
01:02:34.880 tell these clients of mine. Just reach
01:02:36.400 out to 100 people and see what happens.
01:02:38.640 Now let me tell you 95 of them probably
01:02:42.319 will say no or simply ignore your
01:02:43.760 message. Okay that's the reality. Okay
01:02:45.599 but five five of them will be
01:02:47.680 interested. So out of 100 messages 95
01:02:50.559 ignores or nos but five yeses. Okay even
01:02:54.240 if you do a terrible job and only close
01:02:56.640 one shadow operating partnership out of
01:02:58.559 those five interested. Again this is how
01:03:01.040 much money just one partnership can
01:03:03.280 generate you. So, if you wanted to uh if
01:03:05.920 you wanted to get one partnership like
01:03:07.440 this, would you be willing to reach out
01:03:09.119 to 100 creators? Because most people
01:03:11.359 won't. Okay? And that's because most
01:03:12.880 people would rather be right than rich.
01:03:15.359 What about you? Okay. If you had to
01:03:17.599 choose rich or right, what would you
01:03:20.319 pick? Let me know in the chat. I'm
01:03:21.920 curious to see. Would you guys rather be
01:03:23.839 rich or right? Let me know. What do you
01:03:27.039 guys prefer?
01:03:34.319 Rich, rich, rich, rich. Good, good. I'm
01:03:37.280 glad. I'm glad. As I said, I can already
01:03:39.920 tell right now that you guys are by far
01:03:44.319 the smartest audience that I've spoken
01:03:46.079 to. I said I was very nervous to sort of
01:03:48.160 do a presentation that was more on the
01:03:50.079 advanced side of things um and a little
01:03:53.200 bit more technical but seems like you
01:03:55.039 guys are picking up uh more than well
01:03:56.319 and it's I love the fact that you guys
01:03:57.599 would rather be uh rich than right. All
01:04:00.400 right. So, look, you don't know what a
01:04:03.359 creator will say if you don't ask. And
01:04:04.880 if 99% of them say no for every one that
01:04:07.359 says yes, well, congratulations, my
01:04:09.280 friend. You will be rich. Okay? Because
01:04:10.960 the truth is, if someone with no prior
01:04:13.039 work experience can convince business
01:04:15.039 owners to pay them $5,000 a month for
01:04:17.119 marketing services, I'm sure that you
01:04:19.039 can get at least one yes from a creator
01:04:21.119 who's already looking way for ways to
01:04:23.119 monetize their audience. So, are you
01:04:25.520 willing to put in the work to make that
01:04:26.799 happen? If so, great. I'm going to show
01:04:29.200 you how we actually reach out to these
01:04:30.559 creators. The best way to get a response
01:04:32.319 out of an outreach message is to offer
01:04:34.240 them a little bribe for them to respond.
01:04:35.839 Let me explain what I mean. Instead of
01:04:37.359 reaching out sending a longass message,
01:04:39.200 okay, that you want to partner with them
01:04:40.640 and blah blah all like this is going to
01:04:42.880 get ignored. Okay, this is like intense.
01:04:44.559 This is a lot. All right, instead we
01:04:46.880 open the conversation with what's known
01:04:48.480 as permissionbased message. Okay, it's a
01:04:51.119 permissionbased message. You basically
01:04:52.880 get a small micro commitment by saying
01:04:54.720 something along the lines of, &quot;Hey, have
01:04:57.440 you ever considered creating a digital
01:04:58.720 product?&quot; Or, &quot;Hey, do you ever uh get
01:05:01.119 people asking to work with you
01:05:02.079 one-on-one?&quot; Or, &quot;Have you ever tried
01:05:03.760 selling something to your audience?&quot;
01:05:05.039 Okay, you get permission. Okay, from
01:05:07.440 that, you're going to get permission.
01:05:08.640 You get one foot in through the door.
01:05:10.400 Once that's done, it's so much easier to
01:05:12.160 then get another response. Whereas, if
01:05:13.760 you go straight with a long message, no
01:05:15.280 one wants to hear a long message. Okay?
01:05:16.559 People are busy. All right? So, once we
01:05:18.640 get a positive response, we then pivot
01:05:20.319 to the bribe that I talked about. So
01:05:22.079 what we go ahead and we say is I put
01:05:24.319 together three ways you could launch a
01:05:25.760 digital product to your current
01:05:26.880 audience. Would you like me to send the
01:05:28.319 full breakdown? Then we put together a
01:05:30.799 simple monetization game plan for the
01:05:32.640 creator. This is kind of our like little
01:05:34.079 bribe. It looks like this. All right.
01:05:36.720 It's super sick. The idea behind this
01:05:38.880 monetization game plan is that we're
01:05:40.319 going to show how we can help them by
01:05:42.160 actually helping them for free first.
01:05:43.839 Okay. As I said, I also used to use
01:05:45.920 bribes like this to land uh my first
01:05:47.520 clients for my agency. I would basically
01:05:49.359 send full website monetization game
01:05:50.960 plans going over how to make more money
01:05:52.640 from their website. Let me actually show
01:05:55.119 you. By the way, my team is going to
01:05:56.720 play a clip from a loom that I recorded
01:05:58.240 all the way back in 2018 going over a
01:06:00.480 game plan for a potential deal that I
01:06:02.079 tried to land. So, this is basically
01:06:04.000 what I would do. And by the way, at the
01:06:05.920 end of it all, you know, once I actually
01:06:07.440 sent this loom, this is cool. So, I
01:06:09.200 think the date on this is well, it says
01:06:11.119 over 7 years ago, but I think if you
01:06:12.559 look at the data on this, it was
01:06:13.599 actually the month prior. And right
01:06:15.359 after that, I ended up signing them as a
01:06:17.520 client for my agency as a result of the
01:06:19.599 monetization game plan. Can we just roll
01:06:21.119 the clip real quick? Do you have it?
01:06:24.319 Let me know what's live from London. Uh
01:06:26.000 I thought I'd send you a loom just to
01:06:27.599 kind of wrap up uh everything that I
01:06:29.200 wrote in the email. Basically, what I
01:06:30.559 want to do is just load the cannon. I
01:06:32.079 want I want to get you, you know, this
01:06:34.160 entire lead base. So, by the time
01:06:35.760 October or sorry, February, probably
01:06:37.839 around February is a good time to launch
01:06:39.039 it. You know, by the time you launch
01:06:40.079 your master class, you have a solid lead
01:06:42.799 base. you know, you have a solid lead
01:06:44.319 base of, but then you should probably
01:06:45.599 have at least 10,000 YouTube
01:06:47.039 subscribers. And once again, keep in
01:06:48.079 mind these are highly, excuse me, highly
01:06:50.960 qualified leads. Um, so, you know, I
01:06:53.280 want you to have 10,000 on Instagram,
01:06:55.440 uh, on YouTube, 10,000 on Instagram. I
01:06:57.760 want to show you how via Instagram
01:06:59.280 stories you can nurture those leads. And
01:07:00.799 also, you can, you know, the next thing
01:07:02.160 I want you to do is I want you to
01:07:03.200 pre-ell a crap ton of your master class
01:07:05.520 before you actually go out and you start
01:07:07.280 creating it.
01:07:08.960 >> All right. So, as I said, what's super
01:07:10.640 cool about that whole situation is um
01:07:14.079 what's super cool about that whole
01:07:15.200 situation is I actually ended up signing
01:07:17.440 them as a client for my agency as a
01:07:19.280 result of this monetization game plan.
01:07:20.880 Okay, it was one of the first digital
01:07:22.559 products that I actually helped launch.
01:07:23.760 This is back in 2018. So, this is
01:07:24.880 actually me with the agency client back
01:07:26.559 in uh 20 21st of October 2018. Okay, so
01:07:31.039 it was one of the first digital products
01:07:32.319 I helped launch. They paid me $20,000.
01:07:34.799 Okay, as I said, I have this all on my
01:07:36.400 YouTube channel. Now, instead of telling
01:07:38.400 you, I'd rather just show you. So, once
01:07:39.920 again, uh here we'll play it for you.
01:07:41.839 Okay. Uh
01:07:44.079 so, is it rolling?
01:07:47.359 I found out like 2 3 weeks ago that I'm
01:07:50.400 actually extending my trip. I have a
01:07:52.400 2-day training uh with a company out
01:07:54.640 here called Motivate Design. So, if you
01:07:57.119 guys don't already know, uh for a 2-day
01:07:59.440 training, I charge $20,000.
01:08:02.559 I charge £15,000 which is equivalent to
01:08:05.280 like 195,000 something like that. But um
01:08:07.920 as always I was going to go ahead and
01:08:09.280 put up uh the first strike payment. So
01:08:11.440 basically uh way it works is I do 50% up
01:08:14.000 front and then 50% uh after the event is
01:08:16.479 done. So the vents or the 2-day training
01:08:18.719 starts in like 3 or 4 days. Yeah. By the
01:08:21.520 time I'm I'm editing this on the flight
01:08:23.198 back, uh I would have had the first 7500
01:08:25.600 lb deposit through. Uh but then what I'm
01:08:27.839 going to do is I'm going to put up the
01:08:29.120 uh email thread between us basically
01:08:30.640 outlining, you know, how payment works.
01:08:32.560 So you'll see that I do 50% up front and
01:08:34.479 then 50% uh once the event is done. So
01:08:37.040 yeah, that's pretty cool. You know,
01:08:38.479 $20,000 for 2 days.
01:08:41.439 >> But you have to like create a random BS
01:08:43.759 campaign and then that's the only way
01:08:45.279 you can get in
01:08:45.920 >> really. It's like pretty [ __ ]
01:08:48.158 >> And then all right guys, we're here at
01:08:50.158 Motivate Design. This is Mona. Hi Mona.
01:08:52.319 You want to introduce yourself?
01:08:53.120 >> Hi. I'm the CEO and founder of Motivate
01:08:54.799 Design.
01:08:55.439 >> And um
01:08:57.198 This is a second day of the 2-day
01:08:59.120 training and take a quick little lunch
01:09:01.279 break.
01:09:01.679 >> I'm the CEO of Motivate Design. It's a
01:09:03.359 user experience research and design
01:09:05.120 agency here in New York City. We get to
01:09:06.719 work with some pretty awesome brands.
01:09:07.839 Nike and Facebook, uh, a bunch of banks
01:09:09.920 like First Republic Bank.
01:09:11.040 >> So, I'm here doing a two-day training
01:09:12.319 for Mona and uh, and the rest of our
01:09:13.839 team. So, uh, yeah, we're we're back on.
01:09:16.560 All right. Well, uh, guys, as we were
01:09:18.640 watching this and I'm watching the
01:09:20.158 67,000 people here right now, you know
01:09:22.080 what's so funny? I saw a couple people,
01:09:23.439 they were like, I have Photoshop, too.
01:09:25.600 Ladies and gentlemen, that is an
01:09:26.799 example. And I'm going to try to say
01:09:28.719 this in the most respectful way
01:09:29.679 possible. That's an example. And I hope
01:09:31.198 that you guys when you see someone like
01:09:32.799 that in that level of thinking, remember
01:09:34.399 what I told you. There's some people
01:09:35.439 that want to be right. And there's some
01:09:36.960 people that want to be rich. Okay? So,
01:09:38.479 there's some people, and by the way, 99%
01:09:41.040 of you guys are watching this and going,
01:09:42.719 I don't want to be right. Okay? And what
01:09:44.560 I mean by right is some of you guys may
01:09:46.158 have come in today with um some
01:09:49.120 preconceptions. Oh, I can't do this.
01:09:51.120 This is a scam. Oh, this doesn't work.
01:09:53.120 And I yet I can sit here and show you
01:09:55.360 evidence from eight years ago or no yeah
01:09:58.159 eight years ago at this point of me
01:09:59.600 doing this. Okay. Me doing a much harder
01:10:01.840 version of this. And yet some people
01:10:03.840 will still doubt it. Those are the 1% of
01:10:05.600 people that would rather be right. They
01:10:07.199 would rather focus on their they would
01:10:09.360 rather indulge themselves in their own
01:10:12.000 beliefs. Oh like this can't work or I
01:10:13.760 could never make this work. They would
01:10:14.719 ra they're so engulfed in their own
01:10:16.880 beliefs and they want to be so right
01:10:18.239 that this doesn't work or this is a scam
01:10:19.600 or this is a blah blah blah. But you you
01:10:22.560 watching this, okay, you're the person
01:10:25.199 that would rather be rich. So I see it.
01:10:26.800 I see it all the time. You guys are like
01:10:28.560 rich, rich. You'd rather be rich than be
01:10:30.800 right. And for that, I just want to say
01:10:32.320 I commend you. I respect you. Okay? And
01:10:35.760 um yeah, you guys are absolute badasses.
01:10:38.000 I see that a lot of people uh in here
01:10:40.719 are smart. Okay? So, uh, and by the way,
01:10:44.159 you know, I don't ever want to, uh, dunk
01:10:46.159 on anyone or I'm not trying to, uh, be
01:10:48.159 mean in any way, but really truly, you
01:10:50.239 need to understand that the competition
01:10:52.159 is so low because so many people, they
01:10:54.800 don't even let themselves put their foot
01:10:56.320 through the door. You could show them
01:10:57.600 everything. You could give them
01:10:58.880 everything on a silver platter and they
01:11:00.880 still wouldn't do it. Okay? Because, as
01:11:02.960 I said, some people would rather be
01:11:04.400 right than rich. So, I just want to give
01:11:07.520 you a little bit of context that might
01:11:08.640 have seemed a bit random as to why am I
01:11:10.000 showing you this clips? Let me give you
01:11:11.600 some context. Back then, okay, back in
01:11:14.080 2018, I used to charge a setup fee for
01:11:16.480 these partnerships. Okay? So, that's why
01:11:17.760 you saw the bank wires right there. Now,
01:11:19.679 as I mentioned already, when you're
01:11:21.120 starting out, you don't charge them
01:11:22.560 anything. So, the model that I did was
01:11:24.400 way harder, was way more difficult than
01:11:26.480 what it is that you're doing. Okay? When
01:11:28.159 you're doing this, this wasn't a micro
01:11:30.080 creator, okay? This is a big, okay,
01:11:31.360 technically had a small social media
01:11:32.800 following, but this is a big business.
01:11:34.239 Okay? This is a multi-million dollar a
01:11:35.360 year business. Okay? So, this is like
01:11:36.560 the harder version of it. That's not
01:11:38.080 what you're doing, right? you are going
01:11:39.199 to micro influencers, okay? You're going
01:11:40.960 to micro creators and you don't charge
01:11:42.560 them anything. You just take a slice of
01:11:44.080 the profits, okay? So, just to give you
01:11:46.560 context there. So, here I made $20,000
01:11:49.520 from a game plan that I sent all of that
01:11:51.520 by following the very same principle.
01:11:53.040 Okay? Show that you can help them by
01:11:54.800 actually helping them. This works. Okay?
01:11:56.640 So, let me walk you through each section
01:11:58.480 of this monetization game plan so that
01:12:00.640 way you understand why this works so
01:12:02.080 well. This is a psychological weapon
01:12:04.239 designed to do one thing. Make the
01:12:05.840 creator realize that they are sitting on
01:12:07.520 a gold mine and that you are the only
01:12:09.920 one with the map to extract it. So,
01:12:11.920 let's break down what that means. First,
01:12:13.280 you're going to show them that you've
01:12:14.480 done your homework, their follower
01:12:16.159 account, their content niche, and what
01:12:17.679 it is that they do. But here's the key,
01:12:19.520 the hidden transformation. Look at this
01:12:21.360 example. I'll use one of the creators
01:12:22.719 from whom we calculated the revenue
01:12:24.159 potential earlier. To respect their
01:12:25.440 privacy, I won't use their real name.
01:12:26.960 Let's call them Chris. Chris shares
01:12:28.800 fatherhood content through fitness and
01:12:30.480 family time. But the hidden
01:12:31.520 transformation helping dads heal their
01:12:34.000 unresolved trauma so that way they can
01:12:36.080 show up emotionally present and break
01:12:38.080 the cycle for their children. You see
01:12:42.080 when you've identified something deeper
01:12:44.159 about their work that they even realize,
01:12:46.080 okay, they haven't even come to this
01:12:47.280 full realization yet. That is when you
01:12:49.040 establish authority. Okay, you are not
01:12:51.120 just another person reaching out. You
01:12:52.880 get them. Okay, now comes a setup. You
01:12:55.600 you you remind them, look, you've built
01:12:57.199 a dedicated audience that genuinely
01:12:58.800 engages with your content. Then you show
01:13:00.880 them the three topics that they cover
01:13:02.480 that have the best monetization
01:13:03.840 potential. For Chris, that's healing
01:13:05.679 childhood trauma for better parenting.
01:13:07.280 That's the strongest opportunity. Then
01:13:08.800 is staying fit and present as a dad. And
01:13:10.800 then it's building emotional connection
01:13:12.159 with your kids. Do you notice what we're
01:13:13.760 doing here? We're not making up random
01:13:15.600 product ideas. Instead, we are showing
01:13:17.360 them that their own content, the stuff
01:13:19.280 that their audience already loves, can
01:13:21.120 be turned into something that they're
01:13:22.400 paying for. Once again, you're
01:13:23.600 presenting an opportunity, okay? You're
01:13:25.440 not even charging them any money.
01:13:26.800 They're already doing this. Okay? This
01:13:28.400 is why you are literally you're pulling
01:13:30.960 together all these competitive
01:13:32.080 advantages. You're going to people with
01:13:33.360 an audience. So, they have an audience.
01:13:34.719 Like, it's literally so much money just
01:13:36.159 sitting there. They don't want to
01:13:37.679 monetize. Okay? Because they're like,
01:13:39.360 there's a reason they have an audience
01:13:40.560 in the first place. They are good at
01:13:42.480 making content. They're not good at
01:13:43.760 anything else. Okay? That's why they
01:13:45.120 have the audience they have in the first
01:13:46.239 place. Okay?
01:13:48.400 They're sitting on a gold mine. You help
01:13:50.239 them launch a digital product. If this
01:13:51.760 was two years ago, I'll be honest, this
01:13:53.199 was not possible for you. But now with
01:13:54.960 the right AI tools, it's actually
01:13:56.480 possible and it's actually doable. Okay?
01:13:58.800 And when you uh go through this whole
01:14:00.320 process, their their eyes are going to
01:14:02.640 light up. Okay? This is where you turn
01:14:04.159 their follower account into dollar
01:14:05.520 signs. We show them the exact
01:14:06.880 calculation I just walked through, and
01:14:08.400 we ended with the total uh uh profit
01:14:10.719 potential number, $76,000. Now, here's
01:14:13.199 what's going through the creator's head
01:14:14.400 at this exact moment. Wait, I can make
01:14:16.320 $76,000 for my audience just by
01:14:18.159 restructuring content I'm already
01:14:19.600 creating either way. For a creator who's
01:14:21.440 working a full-time job, making 30 to
01:14:23.600 $40,000, this is life-changing money.
01:14:25.679 For Chris, it means that he could
01:14:27.199 literally quit his job to go full-time
01:14:28.880 into social media. Imagine how much his
01:14:31.199 quality of life would change, especially
01:14:32.640 for someone with kids. Now, you're
01:14:34.239 solving the problem before they even ask
01:14:36.000 it. Now, they'll go, &quot;Okay, this sounds
01:14:38.560 great, but what product would I even
01:14:39.920 create?&quot; You give them options. In our
01:14:41.840 example here, the Healing Dad Blueprint
01:14:43.920 teaches dads how to identify and heal
01:14:45.600 childhood wounds so that way they can
01:14:47.280 stop repeating harmful patterns with
01:14:49.120 their kids as well as alternative
01:14:51.040 product ideas. The 30-day present Dad
01:14:53.120 Challenge or Loving Father Blueprint.
01:14:55.440 Notice what we're doing here. You are
01:14:56.880 taking their content, their expertise,
01:14:58.560 and packaging it into products that
01:15:00.560 their audience would actually buy. You
01:15:02.159 are doing the heavy lifting for them.
01:15:04.159 And when someone does the heavy lifting
01:15:05.600 for you, when they hand you a clear path
01:15:07.760 to making money, it's almost impossible
01:15:09.520 to say no. Now again, don't worry if you
01:15:12.239 don't know how to do the heavy lifting
01:15:13.600 just yet. Right now, I'm just showing
01:15:15.280 you the manual process. In the second
01:15:17.360 part of today's session, I will show you
01:15:19.120 how to automate all of this using AI for
01:15:21.920 the people that want it. I said all in
01:15:24.080 due time.
01:15:25.920 Now, this is where you tell them, if
01:15:27.600 this is something that you're keen to
01:15:28.719 move forward with, I've put together an
01:15:30.320 entire 14-day launch strategy for you.
01:15:32.320 You are saying, &quot;Look, I've got the
01:15:34.000 entire road map. It's simple. It's
01:15:35.600 proven. It's designed specifically for
01:15:37.360 Instagram, the platform that you already
01:15:39.199 use every day.&quot; Okay. And by the way,
01:15:40.719 this is the exact system that I will
01:15:42.400 share in detail with you in step four in
01:15:44.640 just a minute. And here is the genius
01:15:46.400 part. You don't just tell them that this
01:15:48.080 will work. Okay? No, no, no. Instead,
01:15:50.400 you give them away to test it themselves
01:15:52.239 before committing to anything. You just
01:15:54.000 say, &quot;Look, I've gone ahead and created
01:15:55.679 a simple three-tory testing sequence for
01:15:57.600 you based on the primary product idea,
01:15:59.520 which you can use to gauge your
01:16:00.800 audience's interest before committing to
01:16:02.800 building a full product. Do you
01:16:04.400 understand the brilliance of this?&quot;
01:16:05.679 Okay, let me break break down what's
01:16:07.440 happening psychologically here. Step
01:16:08.960 one,
01:16:10.480 you're going ahead and you're showing
01:16:11.760 them you that you understand their
01:16:13.360 content better than they do. Number two,
01:16:15.360 you're showing them specific topics that
01:16:16.960 can make money. Number three, you show
01:16:18.640 them the exact numbers and how much
01:16:20.000 money they're leaving on the table. Then
01:16:21.760 you solve the, &quot;Hey, what product do I
01:16:23.600 create problem for them, okay? Then you
01:16:25.920 tease them with the launch strategy
01:16:27.199 framework. Then you literally gave them
01:16:28.640 a way to test it with zero commitment.&quot;
01:16:31.199 Now, when they post these three test
01:16:32.880 stories and their followers start
01:16:34.000 replying, and I'm telling you right now,
01:16:35.520 this is exactly what their followers are
01:16:37.199 going to respond. all of them. Remember,
01:16:39.040 they have a small cultlike like loving
01:16:42.640 uh appreciative audience. Like their
01:16:44.320 audience loves them. They they mess with
01:16:47.040 their stuff, okay? They watch their
01:16:48.480 stuff. These are their fans, okay? This
01:16:50.239 is not the, you know, the 95% of their
01:16:53.120 audience that are just followers or
01:16:54.960 whatever. From that 5%, people are going
01:16:57.040 to say stuff like, &quot;OMG, yes, I need
01:16:58.719 this. When are you launching this? Take
01:17:00.400 my money.&quot; This is literally the DMs
01:17:01.840 that they're going to get. Okay? Every
01:17:03.520 single message they they get sounds like
01:17:05.760 a cash machine going off in their ears.
01:17:07.520 And guess what happens next? They come
01:17:09.280 running to you because now they see it's
01:17:11.440 real. It's real. It is not theoretical
01:17:13.199 anymore. Their audience wants this. And
01:17:15.120 they now believe that they are leaving
01:17:16.800 money on the table, potentially a lot of
01:17:18.480 money on the table. And they know that
01:17:20.239 the only person who can help them
01:17:21.600 actually capture that money is you. So
01:17:24.960 what do you think that they're going to
01:17:25.920 do? They message you back and say,
01:17:27.280 &quot;Okay, I'm in. What's next?&quot; Because you
01:17:29.440 showed them that you can help them by
01:17:31.520 actually helping them. No pitch, no
01:17:33.600 pressure, just pure value. And at that
01:17:35.120 point, they are already convinced that
01:17:36.400 they want to do this. They are already
01:17:37.600 convinced that they want to follow the
01:17:38.880 game plan that you provided. So
01:17:40.960 partnering with them becomes as simple
01:17:42.320 as saying, &quot;Okay, so now that you have
01:17:43.600 the game plan and you've seen the demand
01:17:45.040 is real, do you want to implement this
01:17:46.640 yourself or do you want me to do it for
01:17:48.239 you?&quot; When you get to this point, the
01:17:49.920 number of yeses you're going to get is
01:17:51.199 going to be overwhelming. And remember,
01:17:53.199 you only need to get one yes. Okay? You
01:17:55.679 only need one yes for that one shadow
01:17:57.520 operating partnership. That is all it
01:17:59.440 takes for you to change your entire
01:18:00.960 financial situation completely. Now, I
01:18:03.040 know what you're thinking. Man, this
01:18:04.400 game plan looks complicated. How am I
01:18:05.840 supposed to create something like this
01:18:06.880 or uh for every single creator that I
01:18:08.640 reached out to? Great question. And
01:18:10.320 here's the answer. You don't have to
01:18:11.760 create it from scratch. Okay. Inside of
01:18:14.080 today's workbook, I'm giving you the
01:18:15.520 exact template that I just showed you.
01:18:17.440 All you need to do is fill in the
01:18:18.960 creator's name and the follower account,
01:18:20.719 identify their top three content uh
01:18:22.640 topics, just like uh uh and by the way,
01:18:24.880 you do this just by looking at their
01:18:26.320 most viewed posts. Then you're going to
01:18:28.480 run the simple math. Then you're going
01:18:29.760 to suggest one to two product ideas
01:18:31.360 based on their content. And then you're
01:18:33.120 going to include the three slide testing
01:18:34.719 carousel based on the templates from the
01:18:36.320 workbook. The whole game plan takes
01:18:38.080 about two to three hours per creator to
01:18:40.480 customize. Now, of course, look, some
01:18:43.120 people are going to get lucky and on
01:18:44.400 their 17th creator, they land a
01:18:46.239 partnership. But in general, okay, if
01:18:48.400 I'm being 100% honest with you, the
01:18:50.880 range is anywhere from 50 to 100
01:18:53.520 outreach messages to land one
01:18:55.360 partnership. That is the honest, no
01:18:57.040 [ __ ] I'm not going to tell you lies
01:18:59.440 like everyone else will in 2026 that
01:19:01.360 it's going to take 2 seconds and you're
01:19:02.640 going to become a multi-millionaire
01:19:03.920 overnight. No, this is the honest
01:19:05.520 truthful range. Okay? So, if you do this
01:19:09.199 manually on the low end, it's going to
01:19:11.600 take you from about 100 to 150 hours.
01:19:14.640 And I'll be honest, that's a lot. I know
01:19:16.320 it's a lot, but once again, as I said, I
01:19:18.400 am not here to make you feel all warm
01:19:20.239 and fuzzy. I'm here to tell you what
01:19:22.640 actually works. And by the way, even if
01:19:25.360 it takes 100 hours of work or 150 hours
01:19:27.520 or 200 hours of work, knowing that it
01:19:29.600 can turn into a 10,000, 20,000 or even
01:19:31.360 50,000 shadow operating deal, are you
01:19:33.280 willing to put the time in to make this
01:19:34.960 work? Or if you do want the warm and
01:19:37.360 fuzzy way to do this, as promised, as I
01:19:39.199 said, for 99% of people, they will want
01:19:41.199 the do-it-yourself way. But for those of
01:19:43.280 you guys who want it, I will show you
01:19:44.880 how to have it done for you by AI at the
01:19:47.040 end, which, as I said, cuts down each
01:19:48.960 one of these from 2 to three hours per
01:19:51.120 creator to only 10 minutes per creator.
01:19:53.120 Okay? Okay, so this speeds things up a
01:19:54.800 lot. Okay, so now we have uh or at this
01:19:58.320 point we would have found a potential
01:19:59.520 creator. We've got a creator who said
01:20:01.199 yes to partnering with you. Okay, now
01:20:03.760 what? Now you need to help them develop
01:20:05.840 a product. And here's the good news.
01:20:07.120 This is the easiest part of this entire
01:20:08.480 process because just remember the
01:20:10.320 creator is already good at creating
01:20:12.159 content. They've been doing it for a
01:20:13.600 long time. Okay, they are an expert in
01:20:15.760 their topic which is how they got the
01:20:17.440 audience in the first place. Okay, we're
01:20:18.960 not reaching out to people that have
01:20:20.480 followers just just for the sake of it.
01:20:22.320 Okay, we are reaching out to people who
01:20:23.920 are already experts, who already have
01:20:25.600 authority in their audience. Okay,
01:20:28.560 so you don't even really need to have
01:20:30.239 any expertise. You don't need to
01:20:31.520 understand anything. All you need to do
01:20:32.960 is take what they're doing and just
01:20:34.480 package it.
01:20:36.320 And here's how you do it. Step number
01:20:38.400 one, you're going to look at their top
01:20:39.600 performing content. Which posts got the
01:20:41.360 most view uh which yeah, sorry, which
01:20:42.880 posts got the most views? Which topics
01:20:44.400 get the most engagement? What do their
01:20:46.159 followers ask about constantly? Step
01:20:47.760 number two, you're going to ask
01:20:48.640 yourself, how can I package this as a
01:20:50.480 product? That's it. Bad Prague framing,
01:20:52.800 for example, is fitness tips for dads.
01:20:55.760 That's too vague. Everyone has fitness
01:20:57.760 tips. Good proc framing is the five
01:21:00.080 minute morning routine for busy dads who
01:21:02.000 want to drop 20 pounds without missing
01:21:04.159 breakfast with their kids. Okay, do you
01:21:06.960 see the difference? One is generic. The
01:21:08.960 other is specific. It speaks to a real
01:21:11.199 pain point and promises a clear
01:21:13.120 transformation. Getting this right is
01:21:14.880 the difference between making money uh
01:21:16.719 and making zero. Okay. Once you have the
01:21:18.960 packaging, here is what you do next.
01:21:20.800 You're going to develop the product
01:21:22.320 outline. Okay, that is basically
01:21:24.159 dividing the steps to achieve this
01:21:25.600 transformation into four to six core
01:21:27.760 lessons based on their existing content.
01:21:29.600 And again, if you don't feel comfortable
01:21:31.520 doing this yourself, don't worry. AI can
01:21:33.520 take care of everything for you in just
01:21:35.280 a matter of clicks. Then on step two,
01:21:37.920 you're going to get the creator to
01:21:38.960 deliver these classes live. It can be
01:21:40.880 over Zoom, Google Meets, or even on WP,
01:21:43.440 whatever you find easier. Why live?
01:21:45.600 Because this way you don't have to spend
01:21:46.800 time on developing the product before
01:21:48.480 making money. This is critical. You
01:21:50.560 don't need a perfect polished product
01:21:52.560 before you launch. You don't even need a
01:21:54.159 product. You just need an outline and a
01:21:56.239 delivery plan. This way, by the time you
01:21:58.000 get one yes from a creator to go through
01:21:59.920 the entire plan, launch and uh and
01:22:01.920 profit, you know, that entire process
01:22:03.679 takes about 14 to 28 days. 14 to 28 days
01:22:07.280 from partnership to profit. That is the
01:22:09.199 power of delivering live and launching
01:22:11.280 fast. So, when you close your first
01:22:13.280 shadow operating partnership, can you
01:22:14.960 commit to launching it as fast as
01:22:16.560 possible so that way you can start
01:22:18.159 making money uh from it within 14 days
01:22:20.719 of that first? Yes. Now, if you could
01:22:23.600 literally just copy and paste the exact
01:22:25.040 same strategies that are printing
01:22:26.320 millions on a daily basis and
01:22:27.760 implementing them with a creator that
01:22:29.600 already has an audience that wants to
01:22:31.199 buy from them, do you think it would be
01:22:32.800 out of this world for you to make 5,000,
01:22:34.880 10,000, or even 50,000 with this?
01:22:38.000 Knowing that all it takes for you uh
01:22:39.840 knowing that all it takes for you to do
01:22:41.280 that is to get 1% of the creator's
01:22:43.440 followers actually interested in the
01:22:45.280 product. Okay, that's all we need.
01:22:46.880 Knowing that even if 99% of their
01:22:49.280 audience completely ignores it, you
01:22:51.280 still make a shitload of money. With
01:22:53.360 all, you know, with all that being said,
01:22:55.360 is it really that difficult? If you
01:22:58.639 believe you can do this, drop uh in the
01:23:00.719 chat # shadow operator or just a shadow
01:23:03.040 operator. I want to see the live chat
01:23:04.719 right now. And with that being said, let
01:23:07.600 me see. Let's see you guys spam it and
01:23:10.800 then we'll get back to it.
01:23:16.560 Hashtag shadow operator. Shadow
01:23:17.920 operator.
01:23:20.320 Shadow ops. By the way, I've seen a lot
01:23:22.560 of you guys change shadow operators to
01:23:24.400 smooth operator and I'm actually kind of
01:23:26.800 for it. Okay, so I'm actually kind of
01:23:28.800 for it. So you guys have I I didn't
01:23:31.120 think about that before. Shadow
01:23:32.480 operator. Love it.
01:23:34.738 >> [laughter]
01:23:35.280 >> Smooth shadow operator.
01:23:38.639 Love it. Love it. Love it. All right.
01:23:42.000 Cool. Well, let's get back into it.
01:23:44.960 Look, all it takes for you to become a
01:23:46.960 shadow operator today is to decide you
01:23:48.880 are now one. Okay? So, if you've decided
01:23:50.800 that, comment in the hashtag uh comment
01:23:53.920 the hashtag in the live there. Okay?
01:23:55.920 Now, just wait until you get your hands
01:23:57.520 on the copy and paste strategy that I'm
01:23:59.199 talking about. You see, inside of
01:24:01.120 Monetize, we give our clients 17
01:24:03.280 different monetization methods that our
01:24:05.040 AI tools execute for our users that
01:24:07.520 ourselves and our clients have
01:24:08.800 personally battle tested to collectively
01:24:11.040 earn hundreds of millions of dollars
01:24:12.560 from digital products. They are also the
01:24:14.480 same strategies that we help our
01:24:16.000 enterprise clients apply in their
01:24:17.360 digital product businesses and my
01:24:19.040 consulting firm, Consulting.com. They
01:24:20.960 usually come to us when they're already
01:24:22.320 making seven figures with their digital
01:24:23.840 products and want to scale up to that
01:24:25.199 next level. We have clients doing
01:24:26.719 anywhere from $100,000 a month all the
01:24:28.880 way up to 5 million a month. And all of
01:24:31.760 them, without exception, apply one or
01:24:34.639 multiple of these 17 strategies. Now, to
01:24:37.600 keep the theme of this workshop going,
01:24:39.280 the rule of one, I'm not going to teach
01:24:40.880 you 17 strategies here, okay? That'll be
01:24:42.880 out of the scope of what we are trying
01:24:44.560 to achieve here. Instead, I'm simply
01:24:46.800 going to show you one because you just
01:24:48.719 need one strategy to make a $10,000,
01:24:51.440 $20,000, or even $100,000 with your
01:24:53.920 first creator partnership. And within
01:24:55.600 those 17 strategies, there's actually
01:24:57.280 one strategy that consistently brings
01:24:59.040 the best results in creator product
01:25:00.960 launches. This is the simplest, most
01:25:02.880 replicable, and by far the most
01:25:04.480 effective methodology for a beginner to
01:25:06.560 implement. Now, question for you. Have
01:25:08.800 you ever published an Instagram story? A
01:25:10.400 simple picture with some text on it. If
01:25:12.320 you can do that, congratulations, my
01:25:14.320 friend. You can implement the strategy.
01:25:16.000 Congratulations. You are a shadow
01:25:18.400 operator because that's essentially what
01:25:20.320 we're doing here. Okay? It's what I call
01:25:21.760 the 14-day Instagram launch sequence.
01:25:24.239 And here's what makes this perfect for
01:25:25.679 you to implement as a shadow operator.
01:25:27.840 The creators you are shadow operating
01:25:29.360 for, and by the way, I said technically
01:25:31.520 if you know how to uh um uh post a
01:25:33.840 story, you're actually you don't even
01:25:35.040 need to post a story yourself. Okay?
01:25:36.560 Right? The creators you're shadow
01:25:38.000 operating for, they are already posting
01:25:40.560 stories every single day. They know how
01:25:42.719 to do it. They are comfortable with it.
01:25:44.320 Their audience expects them to post
01:25:46.320 stories. So, you're not asking them to
01:25:48.080 do anything new or different. You are
01:25:49.600 simply giving them a framework for what
01:25:51.520 to post in the exact format that they're
01:25:54.000 already using. Now, before I break down
01:25:56.080 this formula for you, you need to
01:25:57.520 understand why it works so damn well.
01:25:59.360 You see, traditional marketing is like
01:26:01.120 proposing to someone on the first date.
01:26:02.719 I mean, think about it. Someone clicks
01:26:04.159 on a generic ad. They don't know who's
01:26:06.080 behind that ad. There's no face. There's
01:26:07.760 no personal connection, but yet they
01:26:09.440 expect expect people to pull out their
01:26:11.280 credit card and spend 200 or 500 or
01:26:13.360 whatever. Okay? No wonder most people
01:26:15.440 struggle to make money with that. Okay?
01:26:17.199 But with Instagram stories, everything
01:26:19.040 changes because these followers have
01:26:20.800 been watching these creators for months,
01:26:22.320 maybe even years. They wake up and they
01:26:24.320 check their stories. They check uh their
01:26:25.840 stories during lunch breaks. They check
01:26:27.440 their stories before bed. This creator
01:26:29.440 is literally in their pocket every
01:26:31.280 single day. So, when you launch a
01:26:33.280 product through stories, you're not
01:26:34.480 asking a stranger to buy from you.
01:26:36.080 You're asking someone who already knows,
01:26:37.679 likes, and trusts this creator to say
01:26:39.760 yes to uh to buying something from that
01:26:41.920 creator. And that is why you can sell
01:26:43.679 10x, sometimes even 20x more than
01:26:46.320 traditional marketing. But here's where
01:26:47.600 it gets even better. In a situation like
01:26:49.840 that, you achieve all of that with what
01:26:51.920 I call a market of one. Here's what I
01:26:54.719 mean. In a traditional business, you're
01:26:57.120 competing in an open market. If you want
01:26:58.960 to buy a car, there are thousands of
01:27:00.239 models to choose from. People compare
01:27:01.679 prices. They read reviews. You need to
01:27:03.440 fight for a sale. But when you partner
01:27:05.360 with a creator, you have a monopoly on
01:27:08.080 their audience. Okay? When Chris
01:27:09.760 launches the healing dad blueprint, his
01:27:11.840 followers can't go to a competitor.
01:27:14.080 There is no competitor, okay? They want
01:27:16.639 his transformation uh transformation.
01:27:18.639 There is only one place to get it, okay,
01:27:20.560 which is from Chris himself. That is
01:27:22.400 what I call a market of one. No
01:27:24.480 competition, no alternatives, no price
01:27:26.400 shopping. And that is why it's so easy
01:27:28.239 and achievable even for beginners to
01:27:30.239 make this work. You don't need years of
01:27:31.760 experience or anything. You just need to
01:27:33.040 partner with one creator and you are
01:27:34.880 operating in a market where you're the
01:27:36.719 only option. Okay? Do you understand how
01:27:38.480 this changes everything? Even if you get
01:27:40.320 things wrong during the process, do you
01:27:42.239 really think it's that difficult to sell
01:27:43.679 something that the audience already
01:27:45.120 wants and literally can't get anywhere
01:27:47.120 else when you are the only option?
01:27:49.120 Things work even when you make mistakes
01:27:51.120 along the way. Now, let me show you how
01:27:53.360 we activate the desire from their
01:27:55.199 audience. Stories have three
01:27:57.280 psychological advantages. The first one
01:27:59.520 is the ephemeral nature. Okay? It's
01:28:01.360 24-hour countdown time. Stories
01:28:03.520 disappear after 24 hours. Not so and
01:28:06.320 everyone knows this. Okay, that creates
01:28:08.239 automatic urgency. People don't want to
01:28:10.480 miss out on what this creator is saying.
01:28:12.400 Whereas, if you publish a video, people
01:28:14.159 know the video will always be there.
01:28:15.520 Okay, stories are different. People
01:28:17.520 don't leave them to watch them later.
01:28:18.960 When people see a story from a creator
01:28:20.719 they like, they watch it in that exact
01:28:22.639 moment. You can't get that anywhere else
01:28:24.719 in social media. Next is the binge watch
01:28:27.120 effect. Have you ever started watching
01:28:28.719 stories and suddenly realized that
01:28:30.239 you've been swiping for 10 or 20 or even
01:28:32.320 30 minutes? Well, that's by design.
01:28:34.239 Stories are addictive. And when someone
01:28:36.320 starts watching your story sequence,
01:28:37.920 they don't just watch one story. No, no,
01:28:39.760 they watch the entire thing. It's like
01:28:41.360 binge watching a Netflix series, except
01:28:43.600 you're creating a desire for a product
01:28:45.760 along the way. Next is the interactive
01:28:48.080 features, the engagement gold mine. This
01:28:50.159 is actually a secret weapon. Instagram
01:28:52.159 gives you polls, question stickers,
01:28:53.920 quizzes, emoji sliders, countdown
01:28:55.679 timers, all built-in features that make
01:28:57.840 people interact with your content. And
01:29:00.960 every time they interact, Instagram
01:29:02.880 algorithm shows them more of the
01:29:05.199 stories. Okay? So the people most likely
01:29:07.760 to buy are automatically seeing more of
01:29:09.679 your content. It's like having a smart
01:29:11.360 algorithm that identifies the best
01:29:12.960 buyers within your creator's audience
01:29:14.719 and keeps them engaged for you for free.
01:29:17.520 So those are the reasons why this works
01:29:19.840 so incredibly well. Now, let me show you
01:29:21.760 what this 14-day sequence actually looks
01:29:23.600 like in practice. This is the 14-day
01:29:25.600 Instagram launch sequence. It is a
01:29:28.159 14-day sequence that takes someone from,
01:29:30.320 you know, I like his content to take my
01:29:32.320 money using nothing except for Instagram
01:29:34.400 stories. And before you think, oh, 14
01:29:36.320 days sounds like a lot of time, let me
01:29:37.920 remind you, okay, the creator is already
01:29:39.600 posting stories every single day anyway.
01:29:41.600 Okay? So, it's not like you're asking
01:29:42.880 them to do more work. You are simply
01:29:44.480 giving them a plan for what to post.
01:29:46.560 Okay? Instead of random scattered
01:29:48.719 content that goes nowhere, they're
01:29:50.320 following a proven framework towards a
01:29:52.639 sale. The formula is broken down into
01:29:54.719 three simple phases. Phase one is the
01:29:56.800 warm-up days. That's day one to day
01:29:58.400 three. This is where we create curiosity
01:30:00.400 and gather intelligence. The whole idea
01:30:02.560 of the warm-up is to begin to activate
01:30:04.639 the creator's audience and create that
01:30:06.159 tribe feeling. Think of it as sort of
01:30:08.080 lighting the fuse. You're not selling
01:30:09.600 anything. You're just teasing, hinting,
01:30:11.679 getting people curious about what it is
01:30:13.520 that's actually coming. And while you do
01:30:15.440 that, you're using Instagram's
01:30:16.800 interactive features to figure out
01:30:18.320 exactly what your audience wants and
01:30:20.239 what objectives they have. So by the
01:30:22.239 time you actually reveal the product,
01:30:23.920 you already know exactly what to say to
01:30:25.920 get them to buy. Phase number two is
01:30:27.840 value delivery. This is days four to
01:30:29.600 nine. This is where we become the most
01:30:31.520 helpful person in their feed. Over 6
01:30:33.600 days you Oh, sorry. Over six days you're
01:30:35.760 going to deliver massive value, teaching
01:30:37.360 them things, showing them possibilities,
01:30:39.440 proving that you know your stuff. And
01:30:41.199 every single day, you are activating
01:30:43.040 psychological buy buttons, things like
01:30:45.199 authority, reciprocity, social proof
01:30:47.199 that makes them want to buy from you
01:30:48.800 when the time comes. And this is the
01:30:50.560 secret sauce. This is where most people
01:30:52.000 fail because they jump straight into
01:30:53.920 selling. But when you do this first, the
01:30:56.320 selling becomes easy. Phase number three
01:30:58.639 is open cart. Day 10 to day 14. This is
01:31:01.440 where we turn the heat up and really
01:31:03.120 make money. You open the doors to the
01:31:05.120 creator's product. Create scarcity.
01:31:07.040 Showcase social proof in real time and
01:31:09.040 build towards a deadline that makes
01:31:10.800 people act. Okay. And the last day,
01:31:13.360 insane urgency, sales notifications
01:31:15.440 start rolling in constantly. Okay. It's
01:31:17.600 one of the most exciting experiences
01:31:19.040 that you're ever going to have in
01:31:20.159 business. Okay. Whenever you open
01:31:21.840 something and uh you know something
01:31:23.120 sells and you know when you start
01:31:24.560 checking your [ __ ] and you start seeing,
01:31:25.920 oh wow, the creator's getting sales and
01:31:27.520 you know like you can do the math in
01:31:28.960 your head, you're going all right, we
01:31:30.239 got 10 sales. Well, you know 30% of that
01:31:32.320 is mine or 50% of is of that is mine. As
01:31:34.719 you get more advanced, by the way, of
01:31:35.920 course, but 30% is mine or 25% of mine
01:31:38.320 is mine or 35% of that revenue is mine.
01:31:40.320 That's insane. I'm telling you right
01:31:41.760 now, making that first dollar, there's
01:31:43.840 nothing that comes close. And you know
01:31:45.120 what's even better? Rather than having
01:31:47.520 to spend two or three years building an
01:31:49.280 audience, being a, you know, a Tik
01:31:50.880 Tocker and a a celebrity and a dancing
01:31:53.040 this and a dancing that and all the
01:31:54.639 headaches that come with that, instead
01:31:55.679 you go to someone that's already done
01:31:57.040 all the hard work and you go, &quot;Hey,
01:31:59.520 you're making no money. Let's call it
01:32:00.880 how it is because micro influencers,
01:32:02.400 they make no money.&quot; All right, I know
01:32:04.000 because I can see all the data. They
01:32:05.600 make no money. You're helping them
01:32:07.520 launch a product. You're going through,
01:32:09.280 you know, you don't have to deal with
01:32:10.159 any of that headache. You can stay in
01:32:11.360 the shadows. That's why you're a hashtag
01:32:13.360 shadow operator or even better
01:32:15.469 [laughter]
01:32:16.000 # smooth shadow operator for some of you
01:32:18.480 guys. And [snorts]
01:32:19.920 it's just it's an indescribable feeling.
01:32:21.920 And I'm so excited for you guys to
01:32:23.280 experience this for the first time. Now
01:32:25.280 I know what some of you guys are
01:32:26.320 thinking. You man, this sounds
01:32:28.080 complicated. I don't know how to do this
01:32:29.520 whole psychology stuff. Listen to me.
01:32:31.360 You don't need to because I'm going to
01:32:32.800 give you the exact formula day by day,
01:32:34.639 story by story, what to post, when to
01:32:36.400 post it, and what interactive features
01:32:37.920 to use. You just need to adapt it to the
01:32:39.760 creator's specific topic and audience.
01:32:41.760 We are going to break this down step by
01:32:43.280 step on day three. So, make sure you
01:32:44.800 don't miss that one. But for now, all
01:32:46.480 you need to understand is that this
01:32:47.920 formula works. Now, you might be
01:32:49.440 wondering, where does this formula come
01:32:50.719 from? Did you just make it up on the
01:32:52.080 spot? No, no, not at all. In fact, I've
01:32:53.920 been using this formula myself for years
01:32:55.760 now to make millions and millions of
01:32:57.760 dollars. I, by the way, it was using
01:32:59.520 this formula that I beat the record for
01:33:01.120 the most cash collected in 1 hour,
01:33:03.120 24-hour, 7-day, and 30-day on [ __ ] twice
01:33:06.560 last year. Bear in mind, I'm a co-owner
01:33:08.400 in WAP, but even on my own platform, I
01:33:10.320 went, you know, what's the best way to
01:33:12.480 test my platform and make sure that, you
01:33:14.560 know, my platform is working flawlessly.
01:33:17.120 Well, the best way to test it is to
01:33:18.400 break all the records, not once, but
01:33:19.679 twice. So, that's what we did. And the
01:33:21.600 way I did it was using all of these same
01:33:23.760 methodology. Okay? I'm not hiding
01:33:25.760 anything. I'm I'm showing you guys
01:33:27.199 everything. I'm keeping it no BS and I'm
01:33:28.880 showing you exactly how to implement the
01:33:30.320 stuff that I'm even still using to this
01:33:32.080 day. Once again, the only difference
01:33:34.320 here is I used it on YouTube. So rather
01:33:36.480 than Instagram, I used it on YouTube.
01:33:38.159 You know, uh potential to make far more
01:33:39.920 money. It's one of the 17 uh uh
01:33:41.679 monetization methods that we actually
01:33:43.199 give inside of monetize. It's one of 17
01:33:45.440 monetization methods that actually gets
01:33:47.920 deployed through the software uh that we
01:33:49.840 own or license, but it's also more
01:33:52.480 advanced. Okay? So, I don't want to
01:33:53.600 really get into that today. Okay? I want
01:33:55.040 to go for what's the easiest method that
01:33:57.040 you can do that maybe isn't going to
01:33:58.800 make like the craziest amount of money,
01:34:00.400 but is good consistent money. And that's
01:34:02.400 really the 14-day Instagram story
01:34:03.840 sequence. Okay? Now, Jason, who's our
01:34:06.080 special guest here, who you're going to
01:34:07.440 meet in just a minute, he actually used
01:34:09.040 it with email and even on Zoom for his
01:34:11.520 $57 million partnership on a shadow
01:34:13.520 operating project, but the backbone of
01:34:15.520 this formula is the same. So, whether
01:34:16.800 you use it on Zoom, um uh whether you
01:34:18.800 use it on YouTube, like no matter what
01:34:20.320 you end up using it on, okay, the
01:34:22.800 backbone is the same. The methodology is
01:34:24.400 still the same. Okay, what I did was I
01:34:26.560 adapted it for Instagram, the platform
01:34:28.080 where your creators already have an
01:34:29.440 engaged audience waiting to hear from
01:34:31.040 them every single day. same
01:34:32.639 psychological principles. Simply just
01:34:34.639 optimize for the platform that's the
01:34:36.239 easiest for you to execute on as someone
01:34:38.080 who's doing this for the first time.
01:34:39.679 Now, let me go ahead and actually pull
01:34:41.440 back the curtain even further and show
01:34:43.040 you the real magic behind why this
01:34:44.719 formula works. You know what launching a
01:34:46.480 product online is like? It's like trying
01:34:48.239 to crack open a safe. To open it, you
01:34:50.639 need the right combination. And when it
01:34:52.560 comes to promoting a product online,
01:34:54.320 most people are just randomly spinning
01:34:56.400 the dial hoping that something works.
01:34:58.320 Maybe if I post more content. Maybe if I
01:35:00.159 offer a discount. Maybe if I add more
01:35:01.840 features. And they wonder why the safe
01:35:03.679 never opens. But there's a combination
01:35:05.760 that works. In fact, there are 11
01:35:07.920 specific things that you need in order
01:35:09.760 for it to hit. These are what we call
01:35:11.679 psychological buy buttons. Okay? These
01:35:14.800 are the elements that influence buying
01:35:16.639 decisions at a subconscious level deep
01:35:18.719 in the human brain. The stuff that most
01:35:20.800 people don't even realize is affecting
01:35:22.400 them. And look, when you put these
01:35:24.239 psychological buy buttons in the right
01:35:26.080 order at the right time, in the right
01:35:28.239 sequence, that is what cracks the code,
01:35:30.800 just like the password to safe. And over
01:35:33.280 this 14-day sequence, you are going to
01:35:35.040 activate all 11 of these triggers, one
01:35:37.360 after the other after the other, layered
01:35:39.199 on top of each other. So, by the time
01:35:40.800 that you ask for the sale, the safe is
01:35:42.800 open and the money comes pouring out.
01:35:44.400 Now, let me show you how this works by
01:35:46.719 breaking down a few of these triggers.
01:35:48.320 Okay? Remember when you were a kid and
01:35:49.600 you couldn't wait for Christmas or your
01:35:50.880 birthday? Time seemed to slow down. You
01:35:52.639 thought about it constantly. You
01:35:53.600 couldn't focus on anything else. That is
01:35:55.040 the anticipation buy button. And this
01:35:56.800 formula builds anticipation from day
01:35:58.719 one. Every day ends with a tease about
01:36:00.960 tomorrow. Wait until you see what I'm
01:36:02.400 sharing tomorrow. Just like what I'm
01:36:03.840 doing with you here. Okay? I'm showing
01:36:05.600 you all of these strategies and then I'm
01:36:07.280 telling you and later I will show you
01:36:09.360 how to automate this with AI. This way
01:36:11.600 by the time you actually open the doors
01:36:13.199 to the creator's product, people have
01:36:15.120 been waiting for it. Okay? They want it.
01:36:17.360 They are not annoyed by the product.
01:36:19.199 They are excited by it. Then we have the
01:36:21.760 reciprocity buy button. This is one of
01:36:23.520 the most powerful psychological
01:36:24.800 principles in existence. When someone
01:36:26.400 gives you something of value, you feel
01:36:28.159 obligated to give something back. It is
01:36:30.159 hardwired to us, hardwired into us as
01:36:33.120 humans, I should say. And over 14 days,
01:36:35.199 the creator is going to give away so
01:36:36.639 much value, teaching them things,
01:36:38.159 showing them strategies, helping them
01:36:39.760 see what's possible that by the end, uh,
01:36:42.159 you know, when they make their product
01:36:43.360 available, the audience feels like they
01:36:45.280 owe it to the creator. not in a
01:36:46.719 manipulative way, in a genuine, &quot;Wow,
01:36:48.719 this person has given me so much. I want
01:36:50.719 to support them kind of way.&quot; Finally,
01:36:53.360 people want what they can't have. Okay?
01:36:55.280 And they want it more when there's less
01:36:56.960 of it available. And that is why we
01:36:58.560 close the offer at the end of day 14
01:37:00.880 because scarcity forces people to make a
01:37:02.960 decision instead of procrastinating
01:37:04.719 forever. And here's what's wild. I have
01:37:06.560 seen product launches like this where
01:37:08.560 50% of the sales come in the last 24
01:37:10.719 hours. And that is the power of the
01:37:12.719 scarcity buy button. And then on top of
01:37:15.119 these three, we have a bunch of other
01:37:16.719 essential buy buttons that are built
01:37:18.080 into the exact right sequence. So that
01:37:20.159 way by day 10, the safe opens, sales
01:37:23.199 start flooding in. So that way, you
01:37:25.600 don't need to memorize these triggers,
01:37:27.040 okay? You don't need to understand the
01:37:28.400 neuroscience behind them, okay? You just
01:37:30.400 need to follow the formula because it is
01:37:32.239 already designed to dial in these
01:37:33.679 triggers at exactly the right time in
01:37:35.840 exactly the right order. So that way you
01:37:37.840 can follow a step-by-step formula that
01:37:39.679 shows you exactly what you need to do
01:37:42.080 every single day of the 14 days. So once
01:37:46.239 again, I want you to go ahead and drop a
01:37:48.480 shadow operator or a hashtag shadow
01:37:50.480 operator or a smooth shadow operator
01:37:52.320 below because if you can follow
01:37:53.760 step-by-step formula, you can be
01:37:55.360 successful with this.
01:37:58.880 And let me have a swig of water and see
01:38:01.199 how you guys are enjoying this.
01:38:03.840 Shadow operator. Shadow operator.
01:38:12.480 Shadow operator. Love it.
01:38:15.520 All right. Cool.
01:38:17.679 Well, with that being said, let's get
01:38:18.800 into it. So, let's go ahead and bring
01:38:21.040 this back to you and your role as the
01:38:22.560 shadow operator. Remember, you're not
01:38:24.080 the one posting the stories. The creator
01:38:25.679 is your job is just to be the operator.
01:38:27.600 You are going to plan the 14-day
01:38:29.119 sequence, what topics to cover each day,
01:38:31.040 and what to say in each story. What
01:38:32.960 matters is, okay, you're the operator,
01:38:35.360 they are the face, and together you're
01:38:36.880 running a machine that prints money.
01:38:38.560 This formula is really what makes it
01:38:40.080 super easy for you to make tons of money
01:38:41.840 with this opportunity. It's very simple.
01:38:43.440 The creator would never know how to do
01:38:45.199 it on their own because they lack the
01:38:46.719 formula. And the reason most people
01:38:48.159 would never get into shadow operating is
01:38:49.920 that they don't is they wouldn't be able
01:38:51.600 to unlock serious money with just one
01:38:53.679 deal. This formula makes it so that with
01:38:56.000 one deal, you can completely change your
01:38:57.679 whole financial situation. Plus, when
01:38:59.679 you show the plan to the creator,
01:39:01.119 they're going to be so excited to work
01:39:02.480 with you because they see you get it.
01:39:04.320 It's not about you. It's about your
01:39:05.760 plan. That is what sells them. This is
01:39:07.920 why with this business, you can be new
01:39:09.600 and still close big deals. Does all this
01:39:11.760 make sense? Are you starting to get
01:39:13.199 excited about the idea of becoming a
01:39:14.880 shadow operator? If that's the case,
01:39:16.800 here's my challenge for you. I'm about
01:39:18.880 to get into the second section of
01:39:20.639 today's presentation. This is where I'm
01:39:22.400 going to break down how to automate this
01:39:23.920 entire process with AI. And I want you
01:39:26.400 to actually pay attention because I'm
01:39:28.159 going to give you the entire blueprint,
01:39:29.840 the specific strategies. But it is only
01:39:32.239 valuable if you implement it. Okay? I
01:39:34.239 know from experience that most people
01:39:35.600 won't because most people will watch and
01:39:36.960 think, &quot;Oh, that's cool.&quot; And then just
01:39:38.320 do nothing. But you, okay, if you are
01:39:41.520 serious about becoming a shadow
01:39:42.719 operator, which I can tell like I am
01:39:44.400 actually so shocked at how incredible
01:39:47.360 you guys are, like I can tell you guys
01:39:48.639 are some absolute badasses. The amount
01:39:50.480 of times that I've seen people going,
01:39:52.000 &quot;Okay, I'd rather be rich than right.&quot;
01:39:54.159 Okay, I'd rather be rich than right.
01:39:55.520 Okay, I'd rather put my ego to the side
01:39:57.280 and when the opportunity presents it to
01:39:59.520 myself, I'm going to drown out all the
01:40:01.440 noise and I'm just going to commit. And
01:40:03.119 like I'm honestly, I don't think I've
01:40:04.800 ever enjoyed a presentation as much as
01:40:06.159 this one. Okay, so with that being said,
01:40:09.440 if you're serious about creating a
01:40:10.639 5,000, 10,000, or even a 50,000
01:40:12.400 partnership with a creator, if you're
01:40:14.000 serious about having a system that
01:40:15.199 actually works even when 99% of people
01:40:17.199 don't do what you want them to do, then
01:40:19.520 you need to commit to actually taking
01:40:20.960 action on what I'm about to show you.
01:40:22.480 All right? Can you commit to that? Let
01:40:24.080 me know in the chat if you guys can
01:40:25.199 commit and if so, we can commence.
01:40:28.480 Let me talk to you guys about the
01:40:29.840 automated way. Okay, so for 99% of
01:40:32.560 people, they are like, you know what? I
01:40:34.239 just I'm going to do the manual way.
01:40:35.760 It's going to take me like 150 hours to
01:40:38.480 get a creator and then like it's going
01:40:39.760 to take me more time to actually deliver
01:40:40.880 on it and all this stuff. Like that's
01:40:42.320 for most people and that's totally fine.
01:40:43.600 I made a promise to you at the beginning
01:40:45.040 that I will show you the do-it-yourself
01:40:47.199 way and I stick to that promise. For the
01:40:49.360 1% of people that want to go the
01:40:50.800 automated way, here's how the most
01:40:52.880 successful shadow operators are actually
01:40:54.560 implementing the system in 2026. Not
01:40:57.280 with brute force, not with 40 hours of
01:40:59.119 manual work, but with AI leverage. Okay?
01:41:02.000 Now, I need to be very clear about
01:41:03.440 something up front. What I'm about to
01:41:04.880 show you is uh about removing the
01:41:06.719 execution bottleneck. You will still
01:41:08.480 need to choose the right creators, but
01:41:10.080 instead of spending a 100 hours on this
01:41:11.840 process, you're going to spend about 30
01:41:13.360 minutes operating the AI. That is the
01:41:15.760 difference. Okay? That's the difference
01:41:17.280 in time. So, let me go ahead and walk
01:41:19.679 you through the exact same four step,
01:41:21.199 but this time I'm going to show you how
01:41:22.960 to execute them using AI. By the end of
01:41:25.520 this, you will understand exactly how to
01:41:27.199 implement the system even while working
01:41:29.040 a full job. Let's dive in. Step one
01:41:31.199 stays exactly the same whether you're
01:41:32.880 doing this manually or with AI. As I've
01:41:34.880 said, you still need to identify
01:41:36.480 potential creators to partner with.
01:41:38.000 Remember the criteria from earlier,
01:41:39.600 10,000 to 100,000 followers, consistent
01:41:41.760 engagement, a topic that can be
01:41:43.360 monetized, and someone not already
01:41:45.199 selling their own products. Okay, this
01:41:47.920 part requires your judgment, your
01:41:49.920 strategic thinking. AI cannot tell you
01:41:51.920 which creator is right for you uh for
01:41:53.920 your first partnership. Unfortunately,
01:41:55.119 AI can't do that. Okay, now once you
01:41:57.440 have that list of potential creators,
01:41:59.440 that is when AI becomes your superpower.
01:42:01.600 So, let's go back to monetization game
01:42:03.280 plan. The document that makes creators
01:42:04.960 realize that they are sitting on a gold
01:42:06.560 mine and that you are the only one with
01:42:08.719 a map. It has six parts. the audit, the
01:42:11.119 opportunity, the numbers, the product
01:42:12.560 suggestions, the launch strategy TE's,
01:42:14.400 as well as the testing sequence. Once we
01:42:17.199 map this out, we have a full
01:42:18.639 monetization game plan. Again, when you
01:42:20.639 take the done for you approach and
01:42:22.000 create this manually,
01:42:23.920 um uh that or sorry, uh when you take
01:42:25.679 the do-it-yourself approach, I should
01:42:27.119 say, uh and do this manually, that takes
01:42:29.520 hours and hours of research and
01:42:30.800 development. Okay, this would be easily
01:42:32.239 two to three hours per creator. Okay,
01:42:34.080 because you're going to have to watch
01:42:34.960 their content. You're going to have to
01:42:36.000 take notes, identify patterns, write the
01:42:37.600 copy, do the math, and format it
01:42:39.360 correctly. I'll be honest, that's a lot
01:42:41.280 of work, okay? Which means if you're
01:42:42.639 working full-time, you can maybe create
01:42:45.040 three to four of these per week. So, to
01:42:46.719 reach out to 50 creators, that is months
01:42:48.800 of work. Now,
01:42:50.960 if I showed you a way to create the same
01:42:52.560 game plan in about 5 minutes, how much
01:42:55.199 easier would that make this whole
01:42:56.400 process for you? So, instead of taking 3
01:42:58.400 hours, it only took you 5 minutes. Okay?
01:43:01.040 Let me show you how. It literally takes
01:43:02.719 less than 10 clicks. You don't need any
01:43:04.480 prompts, okay? You don't need to give AI
01:43:06.560 any context. You don't need to explain
01:43:07.840 what you're trying to do in excruciating
01:43:09.280 detail. You don't even need any back and
01:43:10.880 forth in a chat to try to get the
01:43:12.400 results you want. The only thing you
01:43:14.480 need is to select the monetization game
01:43:16.480 plan agent inside of the specialized AI
01:43:18.960 and then you just give the AI uh a link
01:43:21.600 to your creator's Instagram profile. So
01:43:23.520 that way it can analyze it and develop
01:43:25.760 the entire game plan based on their
01:43:28.000 specific content. There's no prompts
01:43:30.480 needed. The final result will look
01:43:32.639 something like this. As I said, insanely
01:43:34.560 in-depth content. And with one more
01:43:36.560 click, we can make it look beautiful
01:43:38.480 like this. Okay? Or this. Here's another
01:43:41.119 example of something. And once again,
01:43:42.800 this was created in a space of minutes.
01:43:44.480 If for you to do this manually, cuz I
01:43:46.000 remember back in the day, I used to have
01:43:47.119 to do it, you know, 7, eight years ago.
01:43:49.119 This would have taken you hours and
01:43:50.639 hours and hours of work. Okay, here's
01:43:52.560 another example. These are so beautiful.
01:43:54.480 Imagine being a microcreator and
01:43:55.679 receiving this and seeing how much money
01:43:57.040 you're leaving on the table and seeing
01:43:58.560 how professional you are. Okay, these
01:44:01.679 are all real examples from our clients
01:44:03.840 inside of Monetize. So, do you think you
01:44:05.920 could click a few buttons and get this
01:44:07.360 generated for you by AI when you realize
01:44:09.679 that what used to take days of research,
01:44:11.679 analysis, and copywriting can now be
01:44:13.760 done in the space of minutes with the
01:44:15.440 right AI tool? Doesn't this remove every
01:44:17.840 excuse about not having the skills or
01:44:19.600 the time to create an online income? Can
01:44:21.600 you see how this systematic approach
01:44:23.040 where the AI does all the heavy lifting
01:44:24.960 once you've defined the strategic
01:44:26.320 foundation makes it possible for
01:44:28.159 complete beginners to deliver
01:44:29.440 professional grade game plans that
01:44:31.760 previously required years of marketing
01:44:34.000 experience? Now, here's something
01:44:36.159 crucial you need to understand about
01:44:37.760 this process. There are two types of AIs
01:44:39.679 in the world right now. There's generic
01:44:40.880 AI and there's specialized AI. And
01:44:42.480 understanding the difference is critical
01:44:44.239 if you want to actually succeed with
01:44:45.600 this. Generic AI tools are the sorts of
01:44:47.920 chatbt, Claude, and Gemini. They can
01:44:50.080 write emails. They can answer questions.
01:44:51.600 They can help with basic tasks. They do
01:44:53.520 a little bit of everything. You know,
01:44:54.560 for general use, like they're great for
01:44:56.000 that sort of stuff. But here's the
01:44:57.280 problem. When you are a generalist, you
01:44:59.199 struggle with specialization. It's like
01:45:00.880 asking a general doctor to perform brain
01:45:02.960 surgery instead of hiring a
01:45:04.320 neurosurgeon. Okay? Both are doctors,
01:45:06.639 but specialization makes all the
01:45:08.800 difference. And what we are doing here
01:45:10.560 is creating monetization game plans,
01:45:12.480 developing product outlines, creating
01:45:14.080 14-day launch sequences, and all of that
01:45:16.719 is specialized work. Okay, let me prove
01:45:18.880 this to you. Let's say you want to use
01:45:20.320 chatbt to create a a creator game plan.
01:45:22.239 Okay? Can you just click a button to get
01:45:23.520 that creator for you? No, not really.
01:45:25.280 Right? Here's what you would need to do.
01:45:27.440 You would need to watch the creator's
01:45:28.639 top five videos. You would then need to
01:45:30.159 get them transcribed. You would then
01:45:31.679 need to write a detailed prompt
01:45:33.199 explaining what you want. Then you would
01:45:34.719 get a generic output. Then you would
01:45:36.000 need to revise your prompt. Then you
01:45:37.280 need to try again. And then once again,
01:45:38.800 it's still not right. And you're now
01:45:40.159 you're spending countless hours going
01:45:41.679 back and forth with this thing. And even
01:45:43.679 then, as I said, you're still probably
01:45:45.360 not going to get the depth you need.
01:45:46.639 Why? It's simple.
01:45:49.440 Chat GPD doesn't understand the context
01:45:51.199 of what you are trying to do. It doesn't
01:45:53.600 know what a monetization game plan is.
01:45:55.840 It can't tell you a good product from a
01:45:57.600 bad product. It lacks the psychology
01:45:59.840 behind what it is that we are creating
01:46:01.440 here. You would have to teach it all of
01:46:03.199 that. You you would have to teach all of
01:46:04.800 that through prompting. And most people
01:46:06.800 don't even know what to teach. And you
01:46:08.800 don't need to. Okay? That is why we have
01:46:10.400 specialized AI. Look, do you know what
01:46:12.239 the fastest growing tech company ever
01:46:13.760 was? It used to be Chachi Petite. Not
01:46:15.679 anymore. It is now lovable. a
01:46:17.360 specialized AI tool for creating apps
01:46:19.119 and websites. They hit a 100 million in
01:46:20.880 revenue or sorry an ARR annual recurring
01:46:23.199 revenue in just 8 months. It took
01:46:25.119 ChachiBT two years to get there. Okay.
01:46:27.600 Second place is Cursor, a specialized AI
01:46:29.840 tool for coding. We are entering the era
01:46:32.480 of specialized AI and it is 10 times
01:46:34.639 more powerful than generic AI. Why?
01:46:36.880 Because specialized AI is built for one
01:46:39.199 thing. It understands the exact workflow
01:46:41.440 you need, the exact format of the output
01:46:43.440 and the nuances in the context of the
01:46:45.600 task that you're giving it. You don't
01:46:47.119 need to prompt it. You don't need to
01:46:48.400 teach it. It already knows. And that is
01:46:50.800 also the answer to the question I get
01:46:52.320 all the time. People ask me, Eman, why
01:46:54.159 wouldn't the creators then just use the
01:46:55.600 AI to do all of this for them instead of
01:46:57.600 partnering with me? Because my friend,
01:46:59.920 they can't use Chat GBT to do what we're
01:47:02.159 doing here. Okay? They don't know this
01:47:04.560 monetization strategy. They don't have
01:47:06.080 the specialized AI tools and they don't
01:47:07.920 understand the principles behind it. And
01:47:09.679 that is why they'll make 10,000 20,000
01:47:12.400 50,000 from this partnership because you
01:47:14.320 can deliver what they can't themselves.
01:47:16.080 So when I show you these tools in just a
01:47:18.159 moment, understand that these aren't
01:47:19.360 just easier versions of chatbt. They are
01:47:21.360 specialized tools built specifically for
01:47:23.840 this AI sha uh AI shadow operator model.
01:47:26.719 They understand creator psychology,
01:47:28.639 audience analysis, revenue projections,
01:47:30.560 pro uh uh product development
01:47:32.000 frameworks, and launch sequence
01:47:33.760 psychology. Okay. all of that built in.
01:47:36.320 That is why they work. Now, why do I
01:47:39.040 bring this up? Because specialized AI is
01:47:41.040 the most powerful tool that you can use
01:47:42.639 to monetize creators audiences and do so
01:47:45.119 with less effort, less time, and without
01:47:47.040 any previous expertise. And it's also
01:47:48.880 with these specialized AI tools that we
01:47:50.560 built game plans, beautiful game plans
01:47:52.400 just like this. These are real examples
01:47:54.560 of game plans that our clients have
01:47:56.400 created inside of Motize. So, do you now
01:47:58.880 see how specialized AI built
01:48:00.320 specifically for this exact task is
01:48:02.400 exponentially more powerful than trying
01:48:04.480 to prompt your way through generic AI
01:48:06.159 tools? And can you now see how having
01:48:08.080 specialized AI tools is exactly why
01:48:10.320 creators with the potential to create uh
01:48:11.920 to generate 10,000, 20,000 or even
01:48:13.760 50,000 will partner with you. So,
01:48:16.639 doesn't it make perfect sense for you to
01:48:18.159 start using these specialized AI tools
01:48:20.159 as well if you want to get into this AI
01:48:22.080 shadow operator model? Well, we are
01:48:24.960 going to talk about how you can get
01:48:26.159 access to these specialized AI tools in
01:48:27.920 just a minute all under one package.
01:48:30.080 First, you need to understand how we're
01:48:32.000 actually how we're actually going to
01:48:33.600 help creators develop their product.
01:48:35.199 Okay, so once you have a creator to
01:48:37.520 actually shadow operator for, now we
01:48:39.119 actually need to help them develop a
01:48:40.320 product. Okay, remember the rule of one,
01:48:42.320 it applies here as well. You only need
01:48:44.080 one product. Okay, it was with one
01:48:45.440 product that I built my career online
01:48:46.880 and generated over $20 million. Now,
01:48:49.119 this used to be the longest and most
01:48:50.719 challenging step of this entire process,
01:48:52.320 which was developing their digital
01:48:53.600 product. I remember back in the day, I
01:48:55.760 had a agency client of mine, okay? They
01:48:58.480 paid their setup fee, but they didn't
01:49:00.239 have their product done yet. So, for us,
01:49:01.440 we couldn't, you know, build a funnel,
01:49:02.880 we couldn't run the ads, we, you know,
01:49:04.080 stuff. By the way, all this stuff is not
01:49:05.600 applicable to you. And even earlier, by
01:49:07.280 the way, when I showed you like me
01:49:08.560 setting a loom, and they could see my f
01:49:09.920 like a lot of that was highle stuff. I
01:49:11.679 did the much much more advanced
01:49:13.280 difficult version of this. This is the
01:49:15.600 2026 latest and greatest. We have all
01:49:18.239 these tools, all these resources. So,
01:49:19.920 like I did a version of this that was
01:49:22.320 like 100x harder. Okay, you guys, like
01:49:24.719 I'm very jealous that you guys have this
01:49:26.400 uh these options and these abilities.
01:49:27.920 Okay, so as I said, back when I was
01:49:30.000 running my agency, I had this client,
01:49:31.119 they paid the setup fee, but they hadn't
01:49:33.040 created the product yet. Okay, fast
01:49:34.880 forward over a year, no matter how many
01:49:36.480 times I hit ping them on Slack, no
01:49:38.080 matter how many times I messaged them,
01:49:39.679 they still hadn't finished their
01:49:41.360 product. Okay? Because back then it took
01:49:43.360 an insane amount of work to create high
01:49:45.440 quality uh uh quality digital products.
01:49:47.600 But now with specialized AI, this has
01:49:49.840 become the easiest part of the process.
01:49:51.679 You barely need to do any work. So
01:49:53.920 here's uh what to do. Remember the
01:49:55.600 monetization game plan that we generated
01:49:57.199 in the last step. All we need to do is
01:49:59.360 copy that document and paste it into
01:50:01.280 another specialized AI tool that will
01:50:03.280 help us develop the product for the
01:50:04.880 creator. The first specialized AI tool
01:50:07.199 already did all the heavy lifting for
01:50:08.719 us. So that way we don't need to feed
01:50:10.239 any more inputs or prompts here. Okay?
01:50:12.480 Just with the content you pasted here,
01:50:14.320 it's going to suggest 20 potential
01:50:16.159 products to launch for for this uh
01:50:18.400 creator's audience. All you need to do
01:50:20.400 is select one and it's going to de
01:50:22.400 develop the entire outline for this
01:50:24.159 product based on the content from this
01:50:26.080 creator. And that is literally all you
01:50:28.000 need to do before you actually go ahead
01:50:29.840 and start selling. Why? Same thing as I
01:50:32.480 said before. The easiest way to launch a
01:50:34.480 digital product is to take this outline
01:50:36.239 and get your creator to deliver each
01:50:38.159 step of the outline live. Literally, as
01:50:40.400 I'm doing right here with you right now,
01:50:42.320 and uh you do that after you sold the
01:50:44.960 product with our 14-day story sequence
01:50:46.480 that we covered in step four. Because
01:50:48.000 this way, the creator doesn't need to
01:50:49.600 spend any time recording videos to put
01:50:51.520 this product together. Okay? Which means
01:50:52.800 that you can launch fast without having
01:50:54.880 to spend any time with product
01:50:56.239 development before you actually start
01:50:57.760 making money from this. So, do you now
01:50:59.920 how do you now understand and do you now
01:51:01.760 see how simple this is? Okay. And how
01:51:03.840 with a simple step, you won't ever have
01:51:05.679 to worry about, oh, but what will the
01:51:07.119 creator sell? The AI is going to develop
01:51:09.440 the product outline for you. And all the
01:51:11.840 creator needs to do is deliver this
01:51:13.520 outline live after you already sold the
01:51:16.239 product. Okay? Do you understand how
01:51:17.920 easy this whole thing becomes when you
01:51:19.760 do it with specialized AI? Now, the only
01:51:23.199 thing missing for us here is to automate
01:51:25.119 all the steps of this process to develop
01:51:26.639 the 14-day Instagram story sequence.
01:51:28.239 This is the one strategy that you need
01:51:29.520 to make 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 from a
01:51:31.600 shadow operating partnership. Now, as
01:51:33.600 you can imagine, putting together a
01:51:35.040 sequence like this that turns Instagram
01:51:36.719 followers into buyers requires quite a
01:51:38.880 lot of skills and that is what
01:51:40.400 copywriters specialize in. And that is
01:51:42.400 why
01:51:46.480 sometimes for a single promotion like
01:51:48.560 this, okay, Jason, for example, he made
01:51:51.440 $57 million from a single launch as a
01:51:53.520 shadow operator. Can you imagine that?
01:51:55.280 For years, this promotion held the
01:51:56.800 record for the biggest product launch
01:51:58.159 ever in the industry. And that was four
01:52:01.280 years ago.
01:52:02.960 And look, can you imagine how much this
01:52:04.480 one partnership earned him? Okay,
01:52:06.159 millions of dollars to say the least.
01:52:07.599 Probably more than what most people
01:52:08.960 would need to retire. And the strategy
01:52:10.880 he used on the 57 million shadow
01:52:12.480 operating partnership, it follows the
01:52:14.239 exact three phases of our Instagram
01:52:16.000 launch formula: warm-up, value delivery,
01:52:18.159 and cart open. Now, Jason has been
01:52:20.400 studying copywriting, persuasion, and
01:52:22.239 human psychology for literally decades.
01:52:24.239 And historically, creating the assets
01:52:26.239 you needed to apply this strategy would
01:52:27.679 require you either spending years
01:52:29.119 learning copywriting uh yourself or you
01:52:31.520 would h have to hire a copywriter who
01:52:34.000 you'd have to pay at least $10,000 a
01:52:35.760 month to actually put something like
01:52:37.040 this together for you. And by the way,
01:52:38.320 that's exactly what I used to do back
01:52:39.440 when I was running my agency. I used to
01:52:41.040 have a copywriter who wrote all the copy
01:52:42.639 for the multiple clients that we had.
01:52:44.320 But you don't need to. By the way, this
01:52:45.440 is Kieran. He was my copywriter because
01:52:48.239 shout out Kieran by the way. Absolutely
01:52:49.440 legend. Because look, now it is possible
01:52:51.440 to follow the same structure without you
01:52:53.199 needing to have all this expertise
01:52:54.560 yourself. Okay? And with what I'm about
01:52:56.400 to show you, you can apply the same
01:52:57.840 structure to launch a product
01:53:09.599 AI. If you watch the teaser that played
01:53:11.520 before the session started, you'll
01:53:12.800 remember the graph. It basically showed
01:53:14.480 how on one hand, it's getting harder and
01:53:16.400 harder to get a regular job. But if
01:53:18.480 we're playing on the right side of the
01:53:19.679 equation, it also means that we can now
01:53:21.119 do many things that just a few short
01:53:22.800 years ago would have required a whole
01:53:24.480 team like creating a launch sequence.
01:53:26.800 Okay, which means you can now create
01:53:28.159 this entire structure for yourself using
01:53:30.080 specialized AI. And by the way, that
01:53:31.840 huge discrepancy there on the graph that
01:53:33.520 was from generic AI. Imagine what will
01:53:35.280 happen once people start catching up to
01:53:36.800 specialized AI. That shift there won't
01:53:39.280 even compare. And you right now have the
01:53:41.520 opportunity to be on the forefront of
01:53:43.760 this revolution. Have you ever wanted to
01:53:45.520 be early to something big? Well, this
01:53:48.080 might be it. Okay, so here's how you
01:53:49.679 actually apply this in practice. You can
01:53:51.199 use specialized AI to generate the
01:53:52.719 content of each of the 14 days for you
01:53:54.880 without you actually having to write a
01:53:56.480 single letter yourself. The process is
01:53:58.800 exactly the same as we went through to
01:54:00.800 generate the audit. Okay, very simple.
01:54:02.800 The only difference is you already fed
01:54:04.880 the AI with the information about the
01:54:06.400 creator. Okay, so all you need to do is
01:54:08.480 select the specialized AI agent for the
01:54:10.320 14-day story sequence, select the day
01:54:12.320 you want to develop the content for, and
01:54:14.159 click generate. It will generate the
01:54:15.920 content for that entire sequence for
01:54:17.679 you. Here is an example of what it
01:54:19.520 generated for me for day six of the
01:54:21.440 content. Now, if you pay attention, you
01:54:23.119 can spot some of those psychological buy
01:54:24.560 buttons we talked about earlier.
01:54:25.760 Anticipation, identification, uh,
01:54:27.920 reciprocity. You'll notice how we are
01:54:29.920 pushing all those buy buttons without
01:54:31.840 selling by actually getting people
01:54:33.360 invested in this idea of a potential
01:54:35.360 transformation that they already desire.
01:54:37.360 Then you just send the creator this text
01:54:39.360 output of the AI generated. And all the
01:54:41.760 creator has to do is post the sequence
01:54:43.599 as a story. They can post as a video
01:54:45.440 going over the script if they want or
01:54:46.800 they can literally just post it as a
01:54:48.320 text on their stories like I usually do.
01:54:51.040 This was just the day one example. If
01:54:52.480 you follow the sequence for 14 days, you
01:54:54.159 have the potential to unlock tens of
01:54:55.599 thousands of dollars from their
01:54:56.880 audience. Money that goes straight into
01:54:58.639 your bank account. And remember, this is
01:55:00.080 already counting on 99% of their
01:55:02.080 audience simply ignoring the entire
01:55:04.080 sequence completely. What other strategy
01:55:06.239 or business do you know that can make
01:55:07.920 you this much money even when 99% of the
01:55:10.719 potential customers do not take the
01:55:12.400 action that you want them to? Literally
01:55:13.920 99% of their audience and 99% of the
01:55:16.320 customers ignore buying, don't buy, but
01:55:19.040 from that 1% you still make so much
01:55:21.280 money. This is the difference of this AI
01:55:24.320 uh uh sorry the AI shadow operator
01:55:26.800 business model. Okay, we are not
01:55:28.400 counting on everything working as well
01:55:29.840 as possible and you know and
01:55:31.360 unfortunately that's what most people
01:55:32.480 do. Okay, we are counting that most
01:55:34.400 people won't buy and we still make
01:55:36.320 life-changing amounts from one shadow
01:55:38.159 operating partnership. So my question to
01:55:41.119 you is do you think you can do that?
01:55:42.639 Click a button to generate the content
01:55:44.159 for each day. If you remember back from
01:55:46.159 yesterday's episode, a key part of the
01:55:48.000 game plan is that we send a demand a
01:55:50.080 demand testing theory for the creator to
01:55:51.760 post. Right? Because that is all you
01:55:54.480 need to do to have one successful shadow
01:55:56.080 operating partnership that can
01:55:57.280 completely change your financial
01:55:58.480 situation. Can you honestly say that you
01:56:00.400 can't succeed with this when all you
01:56:02.000 have to do is click a button to generate
01:56:03.840 each day's content and literally just
01:56:05.520 send it to the creator? when the AI is
01:56:07.520 literally doing all of the strategic
01:56:09.119 work for you that used to require
01:56:10.800 decades of expertise. Guys, this is the
01:56:13.679 stuff we would have killed to have for
01:56:15.440 back in the days. So, isn't it
01:56:17.440 incredible that what used to be an
01:56:18.800 incredibly profitable but extremely
01:56:21.119 exclusive club is now available to those
01:56:23.360 with the right tools? Let me make this
01:56:24.800 clear. This has always been profitable.
01:56:26.560 Okay, this is not anything new or
01:56:28.080 gimmicky or yada y this has been there.
01:56:30.880 It okay, this is not a new business
01:56:32.400 model. This is not a new fad or a new
01:56:34.560 trick. Okay, it's just simply with right
01:56:37.360 now with the right tools is become
01:56:38.960 available for people like you to join
01:56:41.119 this club. For the past 20 years, making
01:56:42.960 money online required you to burn the
01:56:44.639 boats. Okay, quit your job, go all in,
01:56:46.480 risk everything. And frankly, that's a
01:56:48.239 stupid decision for most people. Most
01:56:50.159 people can't afford to quit their jobs
01:56:51.599 and hope something works. They have
01:56:52.800 mortgages, they have kids, they have
01:56:54.320 responsibilities. But now AI has made it
01:56:56.480 possible to pursue pursue this part
01:56:58.639 time, okay? To test it while keeping
01:57:00.800 your job to prove it works before
01:57:02.400 risking everything. And that is why I
01:57:04.159 built these specialized AI tools that
01:57:05.840 I've shown you in today's presentation.
01:57:07.679 Not to help you, okay, uh, get hundreds
01:57:09.920 of partnership, but instead to help you
01:57:11.840 get one partnership, one that can make
01:57:13.920 you $6,000, $14,000, $35,000 if you pick
01:57:17.119 the right creator, and do so by getting
01:57:19.199 your hands in what is now the most
01:57:20.639 powerful tool in the history of mankind,
01:57:22.800 specialized AI. So, when I show you this
01:57:25.440 offer in a moment, I'm not asking you to
01:57:27.360 bet everything. In fact, I'm actually
01:57:28.639 asking you to do the opposite. I'm
01:57:30.480 asking you to invest in the tools that
01:57:32.080 make this possible. part-time because
01:57:33.599 the last thing I want for you to do is
01:57:35.360 quit your job and hope this works. That
01:57:37.440 is not smart. What's smart is testing it
01:57:39.679 part-time, proving it works, and then
01:57:42.480 deciding what to do next. And this is
01:57:44.159 what I want to offer to the 1% of you
01:57:45.840 here today that want to get into shadow
01:57:47.840 operating without having to execute
01:57:49.840 everything manually and instead taking
01:57:51.920 advantage of specialized AI to get this
01:57:54.000 done for you. So instead of spending 100
01:57:56.960 to 200 hours per partnership, you can
01:57:59.199 spend less than 5 hours. This is exactly
01:58:01.040 what I'm going to offer you at the end
01:58:02.159 of today's session. So look, it is my
01:58:05.520 great sincere pleasure that I introduce
01:58:07.440 to you our latest version of Mis. This
01:58:10.239 is the done for you solution for shadow
01:58:12.400 operating. And here is how this all came
01:58:14.560 together. About 3 months ago, I was in
01:58:16.639 New York looking at our fifth floor
01:58:18.320 expansion at the W headquarters. And
01:58:20.159 obviously while I'm there, I'm always
01:58:21.360 analyzing data. I'm always looking over
01:58:23.199 the numbers. And specifically, I was
01:58:25.599 looking at our top consultant.com
01:58:27.280 clients when I noticed something that
01:58:28.560 really frustrated me. Okay, we had
01:58:30.960 millions of dollars flowing through
01:58:32.320 creators selling digital products. Some
01:58:34.000 of these creators were making
01:58:34.960 life-changing money. 50K, 100K, 500K per
01:58:37.760 year. But for every uh creator
01:58:39.599 succeeding, there were hundreds
01:58:41.440 struggling. Look, they had the audience,
01:58:43.760 they had the expertise, they had the
01:58:44.960 trust, okay? They had all those things.
01:58:46.800 They simply didn't have the right
01:58:48.159 strategy. So, they just stayed stuck,
01:58:50.560 okay? Making pennies from sponsorships
01:58:52.239 while sitting on a gold mine. They
01:58:53.840 needed an operator. And it is in my best
01:58:56.159 interest to source these operators,
01:58:58.080 okay? Because the more money all these
01:58:59.760 creators make, the more money I make
01:59:01.199 through [ __ ] and consulting.com. And
01:59:02.880 that's when I had a thought. What if
01:59:04.400 there was a way for someone, anyone,
01:59:06.320 okay, to become an operator without
01:59:08.080 needing years of marketing experience,
01:59:09.520 without needing a team or huge upfront
01:59:11.599 investment, okay, what if that was
01:59:13.199 possible? And while getting 90% of the
01:59:15.280 hard work done with AI, even better to
01:59:18.239 keep going with our theme of one here,
01:59:19.840 what if we could do all of that? What if
01:59:21.599 we could package all of that up under
01:59:23.280 one single offer? So that way you get
01:59:26.000 this entire four-step process done for
01:59:27.679 you. So that way you have the highest
01:59:29.360 likelihood of succeeding with this at
01:59:30.960 the lowest risk possible. Here's how
01:59:33.040 this works. Everything I've shown you
01:59:34.400 today, the four steps, the strategies,
01:59:35.920 the frameworks, that is the
01:59:37.679 do-it-yourself way. I keep my promise,
01:59:40.000 okay? That's all the do-it-yourself way.
01:59:41.599 And as I said, it's going to take you
01:59:42.880 about
01:59:44.560 150 to 250 hours to do it yourself is
01:59:47.119 get the partnership and then actually
01:59:48.639 roll out the partnership. That's the
01:59:50.239 honest answer, okay? And that's the
01:59:51.760 honest truth. You can go ahead and
01:59:53.840 execute all that manually, but that
01:59:55.679 comes with a lot of risks of doing
01:59:57.280 things wrong and a huge time investment
01:59:59.520 from your end. So, what I've gone ahead
02:00:01.679 and done is I've built for you is the
02:00:03.760 done for you approach. Okay, this is a
02:00:06.400 complete system that takes everything I
02:00:07.760 just taught you and automate 90% of the
02:00:09.599 execution you using the most powerful
02:00:11.440 tool known to man, specialized AI. This
02:00:14.000 way, instead of spending a 100 plus
02:00:15.440 hours per partnership, all you need to
02:00:17.199 do is operate the I the AI in the
02:00:19.199 shadows that is monetized. So, here is
02:00:21.679 what you get inside of Monetize.
02:00:28.400 Starting with the most important piece
02:00:29.840 of this equation, the 14-day formula.
02:00:31.599 Okay, as I've told you already, being
02:00:33.440 able to execute on this formula is what
02:00:35.040 makes it possible to completely change
02:00:36.400 your whole financial situation with one
02:00:38.239 single deal. If you can execute on this
02:00:40.239 formula, as long as you have a creator
02:00:41.760 to apply it to, you can make money. The
02:00:43.679 problem is being able to execute on it.
02:00:45.840 Here's the thing. I can give you the
02:00:47.199 templates, okay? I can give you the
02:00:48.639 structure, and I will. But do you trust
02:00:50.880 yourself to follow it to a tea without
02:00:52.960 making mistakes? And most importantly,
02:00:55.760 do you actually have the time to learn
02:00:57.199 all the ins and outs, the nuances of how
02:00:59.040 to actually apply this formula
02:01:00.159 correctly, the small elements that can
02:01:01.920 make or break it? Because I can teach
02:01:03.440 you that. But do you truly want to spend
02:01:05.199 months and months and years becoming a
02:01:06.960 master to learn this? Okay? Or would you
02:01:08.960 rather just have the specialized AI
02:01:10.480 doing all this work for you? So that way
02:01:12.719 you don't even need to trust yourself to
02:01:14.320 get this right. All you need to do is
02:01:16.159 trust the specialized AI. The one that
02:01:18.560 was not developed in just a few weeks or
02:01:20.239 even a few months but years of work,
02:01:22.320 okay, and trained by one of the top
02:01:23.920 marketers in the world. So that way you
02:01:26.400 can skip all the steep learning curve
02:01:28.080 that I and Jason and many others have
02:01:30.560 have made uh uh millions as shadow
02:01:32.880 operators. You know, we we had to go
02:01:34.800 through this process manually in instead
02:01:36.639 all you have to do is click a few
02:01:38.400 buttons on the specialized AI. If you
02:01:40.639 prefer that option to get all the work
02:01:42.239 done for you with specialized AI, that
02:01:44.400 is exactly what you're going to get with
02:01:46.080 the first AI SAS in this pack in this
02:01:48.480 package. And by the way, if you guys
02:01:50.320 don't know what SAS is, it stands for
02:01:52.480 software as a service. Meaning, we
02:01:54.560 provide you with a software that does
02:01:56.480 the work for you. And the first AI SAS
02:01:58.960 that you get inside of this offer is
02:02:00.400 Ghost Rider OS. This is the exact
02:02:02.320 specialized AI that you've seen practice
02:02:04.400 in practice multiple times today.
02:02:06.080 Ghostriter is a collection of promptless
02:02:08.159 specialized AI agents. That means you
02:02:10.400 don't need to prompt them. You don't
02:02:11.679 need to teach them. You don't even need
02:02:13.119 to tell them what you want them to do.
02:02:14.560 Okay? And you might ask, &quot;So, how does
02:02:16.400 the AI know what to write about for each
02:02:18.000 creator?&quot; The exact same way it did when
02:02:20.320 generating the monetization game plan
02:02:21.760 for us. The only input you ever need to
02:02:23.840 give Ghost Writer OS is a link to the
02:02:25.520 creator's Instagram. It will then
02:02:27.119 automatically extract all the raw
02:02:29.119 materials that it needs for all of its
02:02:31.119 agents. Then, to generate your 14-day
02:02:33.520 story sequence, all you need to do is
02:02:35.280 select the agent you want and click
02:02:36.960 generate, as you've seen in practice
02:02:38.400 already. and it will automatically
02:02:40.000 output your entire story sequence for
02:02:42.080 that day. One that perfectly follows the
02:02:44.560 exact framework without making a single
02:02:46.960 mistake. So, all you need to do is
02:02:49.280 literally just copy and paste this
02:02:50.800 output and send it to the creators so
02:02:52.560 that way they can post as a story like I
02:02:54.800 usually do. And by the way, I'm going to
02:02:56.320 let you guys in on a little secret here.
02:02:58.400 Have you guys ever seen me posting a
02:02:59.920 sequence of a few stories with a text
02:03:01.760 where at the end I ask you to take an
02:03:03.360 action? Maybe, you know, click a link,
02:03:05.679 watch a video, or register to a workshop
02:03:07.360 like this? Well, don't tell anyone, but
02:03:09.360 I don't actually write any of those
02:03:10.560 sequences myself. Ghost Writer makes
02:03:12.400 them for me. I just post them exactly as
02:03:14.719 you will do with a creator that you
02:03:16.239 partner up with. Now, just to give you
02:03:17.920 an idea, on the last event that I ran, I
02:03:19.920 posted 10 story sequences just like
02:03:22.080 this. Okay? And you want to know how
02:03:23.520 much they generated me? $1.4 million.
02:03:26.320 Okay? $1.4 million attributed directly
02:03:28.800 to those 10 sequences. So, every time I
02:03:31.599 post one of these sequences, I got paid
02:03:33.599 $140,000. So, when I tell you that you
02:03:36.320 can make a lot of money, okay, when you
02:03:38.159 have the right Instagram story
02:03:39.520 sequences, I am speaking from firsthand
02:03:41.360 experience. And look, I could write them
02:03:42.880 myself. I've been doing this for years,
02:03:44.239 but I just don't, okay? Because Ghost
02:03:46.000 Writer still does a better job than I do
02:03:47.760 myself. So, I trust Ghost Rider to do
02:03:49.920 this for my company more than I even
02:03:51.679 trust myself. So, don't you think that
02:03:53.760 having your hands uh having your hands
02:03:55.679 on the same specialized AI tool that I
02:03:57.520 use would allow you to put together some
02:03:59.360 insanely profitable Instagram story
02:04:01.040 sequences for your creator without you
02:04:03.119 even having to learn these skills
02:04:04.480 yourself? Well, that is exactly what you
02:04:07.440 are going to get inside monetize. And in
02:04:09.679 fact, I'm actually licensing it from a
02:04:11.280 Brazilian company with thousands of
02:04:12.880 active customers paying to use it. So,
02:04:14.800 this is a genuine true hard cost to me.
02:04:16.719 And by the way, here's the wires. Here's
02:04:18.320 the screenshots. Just in the last 6
02:04:20.159 months, I have paid this company
02:04:21.920 $530,000 in licensing fees. I said,
02:04:24.719 &quot;Here are the bank wires for each
02:04:26.080 payment.&quot; We are literally spending
02:04:27.840 almost $100,000 a month to make this
02:04:30.719 available to you for free inside of
02:04:33.040 Monetize. Now, remember, this 14-day
02:04:35.599 story sequence I told you about is only
02:04:37.199 one of 17 different monetization methods
02:04:39.679 that we give our monetized clients. We
02:04:41.679 actually have a full playbook that we
02:04:43.199 use with our $25,000 consulting clients
02:04:45.440 at consultant.com. All right? and that's
02:04:47.520 to show them exactly how and when to
02:04:49.520 implement each one of these 17
02:04:50.880 strategies. So, here's what I did. I
02:04:53.280 expanded this playbook and turned it
02:04:54.880 into a full-blown program with Netflix
02:04:57.520 level quality. In this program, I
02:04:59.119 personally walk you through the entire
02:05:00.639 process of starting a shadow operating
02:05:02.719 business from scratch and using these
02:05:04.719 specialized AI tools to find creators,
02:05:07.040 partner with them, help them develop a
02:05:08.639 digital product, and finally launch a
02:05:10.560 digital product to their audience and
02:05:11.840 make tens of thousands of dollars from
02:05:13.280 it. And here I include all the details.
02:05:16.080 How to source the best creators, how to
02:05:17.520 message them to get their attention, how
02:05:18.719 to get them to say yes to you, what to
02:05:20.400 do once they say yes to you, once they
02:05:22.560 say yes to you, because most people here
02:05:24.080 just panic, okay? How to onboard them,
02:05:26.320 how to communicate with them
02:05:27.199 professionally, how to use the
02:05:28.320 specialized AI tools to generate all the
02:05:30.239 materials that you need to launch, and
02:05:31.840 how to apply each one of our 17
02:05:33.360 monetization strategies, all covered in
02:05:35.599 excruciating detail. I've called this
02:05:37.520 program the shadow operating playbook
02:05:39.920 and it's built on the exact same
02:05:41.280 principles I have used to teach on my
02:05:43.119 agency programs which have gotten tens
02:05:44.960 of thousands of regular everyday people
02:05:46.560 to get business owners paying them 2,000
02:05:48.400 3,000 $5,000 even $10,000 a month for
02:05:50.880 marketing services. The only difference
02:05:52.400 is in this case you're not asking anyone
02:05:54.960 to pay you. You're doing the opposite.
02:05:56.960 You're offering them money that they
02:05:58.719 don't have which is 10 times easier to
02:06:00.719 get results with. So with the shadow
02:06:02.960 operating playbook, you will never find
02:06:04.639 yourself in a situation where you don't
02:06:06.400 know what to do or what's the next step.
02:06:08.320 Everything is mapped out step by step
02:06:10.159 from the moment you get started with
02:06:11.199 this business model to sending your
02:06:12.719 first deal to your first creator launch
02:06:14.239 to scaling to multiple creators. With
02:06:15.679 this, the question isn't whether you can
02:06:17.119 figure this out, it's whether you can
02:06:18.560 follow simple instructions.
02:06:19.920 Historically, just the program is
02:06:21.520 something I've sold I've sold standalone
02:06:23.840 for $1,495.
02:06:25.920 And with the results people were getting
02:06:27.440 just from the program, can you see how
02:06:28.960 the program alone is worth it? Now,
02:06:31.119 before you can launch your 14-day
02:06:32.560 campaign, you need a product for the
02:06:34.320 creator. So, you might be asking, &quot;How
02:06:35.760 do I create that?&quot; Well, a lot of people
02:06:37.440 fail in this part of the process because
02:06:39.040 they simply don't know how to choose the
02:06:40.560 right topic for a creator. Quick
02:06:42.400 example, recently, we're working with
02:06:43.840 quite a large creator and helping her
02:06:45.360 develop a product. Most of her audience
02:06:47.440 follows her because they see her in a
02:06:49.119 role model, see her as a role model and
02:06:51.840 as a confident and successful woman. And
02:06:53.599 they want to have that sort of
02:06:54.480 confidence too in the way they dress,
02:06:56.239 the way they look, and most importantly,
02:06:57.920 the way they feel about themselves. And
02:06:59.760 during this conversation trying to come
02:07:01.280 up with the right angle for the product.
02:07:02.800 One of the suggestions from this creator
02:07:04.400 was well what if we create a digital
02:07:06.000 product showing women how to speak
02:07:07.520 better in front of camera. Now naive
02:07:10.560 people or beginners okay beginner shadow
02:07:12.480 operators would blindly follow the
02:07:13.840 creator suggestion here and say oh it's
02:07:15.599 a good idea. But the truth is that's a
02:07:17.440 terrible idea and choosing that product
02:07:19.599 would have been a deadly mistake. Why?
02:07:21.520 Because that only applies to a very
02:07:23.119 small segment of her audience. Most of
02:07:24.880 her audience does not want to be in
02:07:26.400 front of the camera. They already
02:07:27.599 struggle to look at themselves in the
02:07:28.800 mirror and be happy with what they see,
02:07:30.239 let alone record themselves, you know,
02:07:32.079 for the whole world. And it was because
02:07:33.840 of situations like this that I spent
02:07:35.599 almost a year developing my own
02:07:37.199 specialized AI specifically for the sole
02:07:39.760 purpose of helping me develop digital
02:07:41.599 products that sell. That specialized AI
02:07:43.760 tool is what I call synthesize AI. It is
02:07:46.000 the world's most powerful digital
02:07:47.520 product creation engine. Okay, it
02:07:49.360 identifies profitable untapped topics,
02:07:51.440 synthesizes the content straight from
02:07:53.199 the creator's Instagram profile. Okay,
02:07:54.960 this is insane. suggests dozens of
02:07:57.599 potential profitable products that you
02:07:59.119 could create on that topic and then
02:08:00.880 develops the entire outline for your
02:08:02.639 creator's product. So that way you don't
02:08:04.480 even have to think about this throughout
02:08:05.760 the entire process. It develops the
02:08:07.679 entire product in around 10 minutes or
02:08:09.599 so. Do you think that you could click a
02:08:11.360 few buttons if that's all you need to do
02:08:13.199 to create a profitable digital product
02:08:14.800 for your creator? That is the power of
02:08:16.960 Synthesize. And once again, I've used
02:08:18.719 this tool myself to create the entire
02:08:20.239 outline for a product of mine which I
02:08:22.079 sold at a previous event. In fact, I
02:08:24.480 actually used the 1.0 version of
02:08:26.000 Synthesize and I made over $370,000 in
02:08:29.599 30 days with it. Okay, almost 13,000
02:08:32.000 people purchased this digital product.
02:08:33.760 It took me around 90 minutes to develop
02:08:35.679 it using Synthesize AI to make more from
02:08:38.639 one product than most people make in a
02:08:40.079 year. And now you get access to the most
02:08:42.079 recent version that we just pushed,
02:08:43.920 Synthesize 4.0. And in this newer and
02:08:46.320 updated version, developing a product
02:08:48.159 for a creator has become extremely
02:08:49.840 simple. All you need to do is copy and
02:08:51.840 paste that monetization game plan from
02:08:53.440 Ghostriter into Synthesize. From this
02:08:55.840 information, it will then synthesize the
02:08:57.599 top 20 product ideas for this creator.
02:08:59.920 You just choose your preferred one, and
02:09:01.679 Synthesize will automatically develop
02:09:03.360 the entire outline for the product. And
02:09:05.040 then the creator can deliver that
02:09:06.639 content live to the people who buy the
02:09:08.480 product, exactly as I'm doing right now.
02:09:10.400 This way, you don't need to waste any
02:09:12.000 time developing the product or creating
02:09:13.679 pre-recorded classes before selling it.
02:09:15.520 So, wouldn't you want to have your hands
02:09:17.199 on the same specialized AI tool that
02:09:19.199 13,000 other people have already
02:09:21.599 validated with their wallets? Do you
02:09:23.440 understand why this tool is listed at
02:09:25.360 $2,999
02:09:26.880 a year? And the best part is you are
02:09:28.800 getting unlimited access to it at no
02:09:30.960 extra cost to you when you join Monetize
02:09:33.040 today because I have preloaded it with
02:09:35.199 $250,000 in credits. Yes, it costs money
02:09:38.239 to run this. A lot of money. As you
02:09:40.079 know, using AI is not free. It can get
02:09:42.239 pretty expensive, especially with the
02:09:44.159 complexity of the tasks that we are
02:09:46.000 doing here. But I don't want you to have
02:09:47.760 to worry about any of these costs at
02:09:49.840 this stage of your business. I just want
02:09:51.199 you to have the most powerful AI tools
02:09:52.800 to make this as possible, as easy as
02:09:54.719 humanly possible for you to succeed. So,
02:09:57.040 I'm paying for your first few AI
02:09:58.560 employees here. Okay? Isn't that exactly
02:10:00.719 the sort of unfair advantage that you've
02:10:02.159 been searching for to finally make it
02:10:03.920 realistic for you to succeed? Now, at
02:10:06.079 this point, you already have the 14-day
02:10:08.000 story sequence done for you with Ghost
02:10:09.599 Rider OS. You already have access to my
02:10:11.840 entire shadow operating playbook walking
02:10:13.679 you through this entire process. You
02:10:15.280 have your creator product done for you
02:10:17.119 by synthesize AI. So what are we missing
02:10:20.159 here back from our four-step process?
02:10:21.840 What was the most time-consuming thing
02:10:23.440 of this entire flow? It was creating the
02:10:26.159 monetization game plan. The document
02:10:28.000 that makes creators realize that they
02:10:30.000 are sitting on a gold mine and that you
02:10:31.760 are the only one with a map. That is the
02:10:33.679 asset that allows us to approach
02:10:35.040 creators and strike a deal with them
02:10:36.639 that could be worth$10,000, 20,000 or
02:10:38.800 even $50,000 for you. Again, this game
02:10:41.199 plan has six parts. The audit, the
02:10:43.119 opportunity, the numbers, product
02:10:44.480 suggestions, launch strategy, tease, and
02:10:46.560 testing sequence. Now, when you do this
02:10:48.960 manually, this will take you about 2 to
02:10:50.719 three hours per creator if I'm being
02:10:52.000 honest with you. Okay? So,
02:10:53.040 realistically, if you're working a
02:10:54.320 full-time job, it could take you weeks,
02:10:56.079 if not even months, to create enough of
02:10:57.840 these before you close your first deal.
02:10:59.520 But with Monetize, you don't need to
02:11:01.119 worry about any of that because putting
02:11:03.040 one of these together can now be done in
02:11:04.880 less than 10 minutes. How? Well, as I've
02:11:06.800 shown you, inside Ghost Rider OS, we
02:11:09.280 already have a specialized agent that
02:11:11.360 creates that monetization game plan for
02:11:13.440 you in a single click. Okay? Including
02:11:16.800 the exact uh uh testing story sequence
02:11:19.199 that you're going to send to the
02:11:20.239 creators that you are reaching out to.
02:11:21.840 Literally, all you need to do is press
02:11:23.599 generate to get the game plans like
02:11:25.280 these completely done for you without
02:11:27.199 virtually any work on your end. Is
02:11:28.960 wouldn't that be incredible? Being able
02:11:30.639 to create unlimited game plans with a
02:11:32.480 click of a button without you having to
02:11:34.079 do any work. That is exactly what you
02:11:36.000 get as a part of montage. Now, what's
02:11:38.400 the one step that I've told you that AI
02:11:40.320 simply can't execute for you? Okay, the
02:11:42.159 part that requires your judgment, your
02:11:44.159 strategic thinking. Okay, I told you at
02:11:45.679 the beginning, AI can't do this for you.
02:11:46.880 I was very honest with you. It's finding
02:11:48.800 the ideal creators. And guys, this is
02:11:50.719 actually the most crucial part of this
02:11:52.239 entire process because if you select the
02:11:54.079 wrong creators here, everything you do
02:11:55.920 after this stops. it just becomes
02:11:58.159 totally irrelevant. Okay? Look, if you
02:12:00.960 don't have the right people to reach out
02:12:02.239 to, they will not respond to your
02:12:03.760 outreach. Okay? Or even if they do, they
02:12:06.239 won't have any monetization potential.
02:12:08.000 So, it is crucial to your success that
02:12:10.159 you find the right creators here because
02:12:11.679 it only takes one for you to completely
02:12:13.679 change your entire financial situation
02:12:15.360 with this. And inside [snorts] the
02:12:17.199 shadow operating playbook, I walk you
02:12:19.040 through the exact step by step that you
02:12:20.960 need to follow to find the ideal
02:12:22.719 creators with a high monetization
02:12:24.320 potential. That's the exact same step by
02:12:26.159 step I used to teach back in my agent
02:12:27.840 agency programs that got people results
02:12:29.840 like this. Now, you can do this by
02:12:31.679 yourself by simply following the
02:12:33.119 instructions in the program. But let's
02:12:34.800 be honest, wouldn't it be so much easier
02:12:37.520 if me and my team source these creators
02:12:39.840 for you? So that way you don't even have
02:12:42.000 to go through this process of finding
02:12:43.599 them yourself? Well, that is exactly
02:12:46.880 what I've decided to do. This is not
02:12:48.719 something that we usually have inside of
02:12:50.320 monetize for people to join. In fact,
02:12:52.000 we've never done anything like this
02:12:53.440 because actually this took a long while
02:12:55.199 to build out. This is a completely new
02:12:56.800 part of the monetized offer because now
02:12:58.639 this is like a manual service that we
02:13:00.400 actually have to do. And once again, we
02:13:01.840 have to build a whole infrastructure to
02:13:03.760 even make this possible. Okay, but for
02:13:06.000 you that have come here today have dealt
02:13:08.400 with all of the technical difficulties
02:13:11.199 and there's been more than one, okay,
02:13:12.800 that have dealt with, you know, hours
02:13:15.119 and hours of super in-depth training. As
02:13:17.280 I said, you know, I I just want to give
02:13:18.880 uh props to you and give credit where
02:13:20.800 credit is due. You guys are such a smart
02:13:22.880 audience and I've had, you know, it's
02:13:24.159 been such an honor to be able to uh
02:13:25.840 share this time with you because you
02:13:27.440 guys are a lot more switched on. I was
02:13:28.800 very very worried coming in here today
02:13:30.239 and going, &quot;Oh, you know what? Maybe
02:13:31.199 this might be a little too advanced.&quot;
02:13:32.480 You know, like there's such a gold mine
02:13:34.159 at the end of this, but you know, will
02:13:35.599 people stay all the way through? You
02:13:37.199 know, it's a long presentation. So,
02:13:38.880 because you've come here, you've done
02:13:40.000 the work, and you've actually showed up
02:13:41.280 here and been here uh with me in this
02:13:43.280 workshop, I really want to make sure
02:13:44.719 you're taken care of. I want to make
02:13:46.480 sure that you have the lowest risk
02:13:48.000 possible of making any mistakes along
02:13:50.400 this process. So that's why I've decided
02:13:51.840 to do the first step for you. Okay? So
02:13:54.239 there's literally no work needed on your
02:13:56.320 end here. You see, my team and I will
02:13:58.560 manually go through the process of
02:14:00.159 identifying creators with high revenue
02:14:01.760 potential for you. And then we will
02:14:03.840 compile a list of 100 uh uh 100 hand
02:14:07.119 selected unique creators that you are
02:14:09.119 going to get access to when you join.
02:14:11.040 Now why 100? Because on average it takes
02:14:13.599 50 people. 50 people you reach out to on
02:14:16.320 average you're going to close one. How
02:14:17.520 do I know? Because I own a software that
02:14:19.679 tens of thousands of service-based
02:14:21.199 companies, agencies, consultants, and
02:14:22.719 shadow operators use to track their
02:14:24.800 outreach. It's called Flozy. We've had
02:14:26.880 over 504,000 deals closed and paid there
02:14:30.320 to date in the six years I've been
02:14:31.920 running it. And I know exactly how many
02:14:33.679 outreach messages it took to close each
02:14:35.440 one of those deals, which on average
02:14:37.199 equates to around 100 contacts per deal.
02:14:39.360 Okay? In fact, that's not even a fair
02:14:41.440 comparison because the that's the number
02:14:42.800 it would take for someone to close a
02:14:44.079 client where they would be basically
02:14:45.760 going to them and saying, &quot;Hey, give me
02:14:47.199 thousands of dollars a month.&quot; Here,
02:14:49.520 your job is a lot easier. Okay? They
02:14:51.280 don't need to pay anything pay you
02:14:52.800 anything upfront. So, you're able to
02:14:54.079 strike deals and partnerships at a
02:14:55.599 higher rate than that. But once again,
02:14:57.679 let's still say 50. Okay? Let's say that
02:14:59.520 you still perform two times worse than
02:15:00.960 the average. In that case, it would take
02:15:02.400 you a 100red to close one partnership.
02:15:04.560 meaning you would still be able to close
02:15:06.400 your first creator partnership from this
02:15:08.000 rolodex of prevetted creators that I'm
02:15:10.239 giving you. Actually, you know what?
02:15:12.000 Because we're sticking to the theme of
02:15:13.199 one. Yeah, because we're sticking to the
02:15:15.520 theme of one, I'm actually going to make
02:15:16.480 it 111. Okay, so some angel numbers for
02:15:18.960 you guys. So, I'm going to make it 100%.
02:15:21.040 Uh I'm going to make it 111 for you guys
02:15:22.880 here today. And uh
02:15:26.239 I'm thinking, do I have to ask the team?
02:15:27.679 No, you don't. [ __ ] it. Executive
02:15:28.960 decision 111 is okay. So, disregard that
02:15:31.599 it says 100 here. I'm going to give you
02:15:32.800 guys 111 sticking to the theme of one.
02:15:35.280 All right. Now, that is more than enough
02:15:38.400 for you guys to close your first
02:15:39.520 partnership. Now, obviously, I cannot
02:15:41.199 guarantee that you're going to 100%
02:15:42.719 close your first deal from this. Numbers
02:15:44.480 are numbers, okay? But the odds are
02:15:46.159 definitely stacked in your favor here.
02:15:48.000 And those creators will be unique to
02:15:49.679 you. I want to make this very clear.
02:15:50.960 These creators that we source are unique
02:15:53.360 to you. No one else will get the same
02:15:55.040 list as you. Okay? This will make ensure
02:15:57.040 that you are working on a market of one,
02:15:59.040 a market where you don't have any
02:16:00.480 competition. And by the way, there's
02:16:02.159 more to it. I'm not just going to
02:16:03.440 deliver this list of 100 creators in a
02:16:05.119 PDF file to you. No, no, no, no. This
02:16:07.119 will get delivered to you directly
02:16:08.639 inside of your own Floy account. If you
02:16:10.639 don't know, Flozy is a software that I
02:16:12.239 co-founded back in my agency days. It is
02:16:14.079 the best alternative in the market for
02:16:15.840 running your shadow operator business.
02:16:17.360 Why? Because Flossy acts like your
02:16:19.199 shadow operator command center. Okay?
02:16:21.280 This is where you store your creators,
02:16:22.639 your outreach tracker. It's what we call
02:16:24.639 a CRM, a client relationship management
02:16:27.119 system. So that way you can track
02:16:29.040 exactly in which stage of the process
02:16:31.040 each one of these 100 creators is at
02:16:32.718 when you reach out to them and what are
02:16:34.318 the responses you're getting. Just this
02:16:36.000 feature alone would make your life so
02:16:37.439 much easier. Hence why all serious
02:16:39.280 business owners have a CRM. By the way,
02:16:41.200 just to give you some context, just in
02:16:43.120 December, we paid £30,000 for the CRM
02:16:46.000 that we use at consulting.com. But
02:16:48.638 you're going to have access to this
02:16:49.760 entire flowy workspace for free with
02:16:52.398 monetize. Okay. We've had over 50,000
02:16:54.799 users on. And for you to get access to
02:16:56.959 this would normally cost you 1,6 $1,68
02:17:00.318 per year. With these tools, you have
02:17:02.318 everything you need to succeed with this
02:17:04.318 process. Think about it like this. Let's
02:17:06.160 say you want to become a carpenter. You
02:17:07.519 could try to build furniture with a
02:17:08.799 butter knife, okay, instead of a chisel,
02:17:10.799 a rock instead of a hammer, your bare
02:17:12.718 hands instead of a saw. Now, could you
02:17:14.799 technically do it? Maybe. Would it take
02:17:16.398 you 10 times longer and and the product
02:17:18.318 is going to be substantially worse?
02:17:19.679 Absolutely. Or you could just get the
02:17:21.760 right tools. And that is why inside
02:17:23.679 monetize I give you the right tools
02:17:29.760 because listen this is the very thing
02:17:31.679 that will allow you to get into this
02:17:33.040 business part-time with very low risk
02:17:35.120 without having any previous expertise.
02:17:37.040 Now I know a lot of you guys would love
02:17:39.200 to have some sort of credentials to
02:17:40.638 actually show these creators. This way
02:17:42.558 you can have a third party proof that
02:17:44.398 you are qualified to do the role and
02:17:46.318 something like that can in increase your
02:17:48.080 authority by 10x in the eyes of these
02:17:50.080 people. So I thought to myself, what can
02:17:52.558 I give you to increase your authority to
02:17:54.080 the highest level possible here? So I
02:17:55.599 had this idea. You see, as you already
02:17:57.280 know, I own a company called
02:17:58.638 Consulting.com, which is the most
02:18:00.000 successful consulting firm in the
02:18:01.519 digital product and shadow operating
02:18:02.959 space. So I have decided to create a
02:18:05.280 consulting certificate that recognizes
02:18:07.599 you as a consulting.com qualified
02:18:10.638 operator. This way you can tell creators
02:18:12.799 when you're reaching out to them that
02:18:14.000 you are officially qualified on this
02:18:15.920 method and that everything you'll imple
02:18:17.840 you'll implement is based on the
02:18:19.439 methodology taught by the number one
02:18:20.959 consulting firm in the world when it
02:18:22.799 comes to digital products. Do you see
02:18:24.478 how this instantly positions you as a
02:18:26.318 qualified professional rather than just
02:18:27.840 another person with an idea and how with
02:18:29.519 this certification the question of why
02:18:31.519 should I trust you to do this will never
02:18:33.439 be a problem ever again. Like can you
02:18:35.519 imagine how much easier conversations
02:18:37.120 become when you can lead with I am a
02:18:38.638 consultant.com certified operator
02:18:40.638 instead of trying to convince them from
02:18:42.240 scratch that you know what you are
02:18:43.760 doing. So look that is another perk that
02:18:46.240 you get for free inside monetize as soon
02:18:48.558 as you complete our entire program. Now
02:18:50.959 to put some fire under your ass and give
02:18:52.558 you an even bigger reason to take action
02:18:54.558 on becoming a shadow operator. I'm
02:18:56.080 giving you a golden ticket to the third
02:18:58.000 edition of our Monetiz Mania
02:18:59.359 competition. Here is how it works.
02:19:00.718 Starting tomorrow, we are kicking off a
02:19:02.240 90-day competition between everyone who
02:19:04.240 joins Metize. 90 days from now, the five
02:19:06.558 individuals who finish at the top will
02:19:08.160 get a complimentary seat at the
02:19:09.920 Consulting.com Quantum Mastermind. That
02:19:12.080 is our exclusive mastermind experience.
02:19:13.840 The clients paid $25,000 to join. For
02:19:16.478 our last quantum mastermind event, we
02:19:18.398 literally booked out the entire wine
02:19:20.478 farm in Cape Town or at one of the top
02:19:22.799 hotels in the world just for our
02:19:24.478 consultant.com clients and we spent 3
02:19:26.160 days masterminding about online
02:19:27.920 business. So, if you finish at the top
02:19:29.679 of the Monetized Mania leaderboard, you
02:19:31.519 will get to sit and spend three days
02:19:32.959 together behind closed doors in the same
02:19:34.718 room as people making 100, 200, $500,000
02:19:37.760 a month from their shadow operating
02:19:39.359 business. You will get to personally
02:19:40.799 network with them and learn their
02:19:42.240 strategies. How insane an opportunity
02:19:44.080 would it be for you to sit in the same
02:19:45.439 room as the top shadow operators in the
02:19:47.359 world today? That is the opportunity you
02:19:49.120 get when you join Monetize today.
02:19:50.720 Finally, I want you to imagine this. You
02:19:52.880 and I working together side by side,
02:19:54.720 locked in for over four weeks straight.
02:19:56.640 How much of an advantage do you think
02:19:58.000 you would have over everyone else? Well,
02:20:00.560 that is exactly what I have for you
02:20:02.000 here. As a special bonus, on top of
02:20:04.560 everything inside Monties, you're going
02:20:06.319 to get the four-week fast track with me.
02:20:08.240 Over the next four weeks, I'm going to
02:20:09.680 personally host four live master
02:20:11.200 classes. Not only walking you through
02:20:12.800 the entire process of going from zero to
02:20:15.120 having your first creator partnership
02:20:16.399 signed, launched, and generating sales
02:20:18.319 using specialized AI, but most
02:20:20.160 importantly, you get the advantage that
02:20:22.960 every single successful person has,
02:20:24.800 which is a coach. Okay, you get direct
02:20:27.040 access to me and that is what the first
02:20:29.040 888 people who join today are also going
02:20:32.080 to get. You and I working together side
02:20:34.080 by side, locked in for the next four
02:20:35.760 weeks straight. And here's what makes
02:20:37.120 this different. When I introduce new
02:20:38.640 opportunities to market, I just, you
02:20:40.240 know, I don't just make money with it
02:20:41.439 myself. Just look at what happened when
02:20:43.040 I was running my agency programs. I
02:20:44.479 helped create the most success stories
02:20:45.920 of this industry to date. It created
02:20:47.920 waves of success stories. It created
02:20:49.840 entire revolutions in the digital uh
02:20:51.760 market. The first time I opened
02:20:53.280 monetize, the people who jumped in
02:20:54.960 earned o over 8.9 million in 90 days.
02:20:58.000 One of those users won a McLaren.
02:20:59.600 Another one Armono bought his own and on
02:21:01.920 top of getting a Rolex directly from me
02:21:03.600 as an award for his performance. The
02:21:05.520 second time I opened it up, the people
02:21:07.280 who jumped in earned 15 million in track
02:21:09.439 earnings in 90 days. The average earner
02:21:11.439 on Monetize, aka someone who had a
02:21:13.280 digital park launch, they averaged $60,3
02:21:16.880 in earnings. My question to you is,
02:21:18.479 would $60,000 change your financial
02:21:20.319 situation? Well, this time we are doing
02:21:22.479 it again, okay? But even bigger. And by
02:21:25.760 the way, when we do something like this,
02:21:26.960 we change the whole fabric of the
02:21:28.479 internet. So, would you like to be a
02:21:30.319 part of a change like that to get
02:21:31.680 advantage of the specialized AI before
02:21:33.600 everyone else shows up? Well, this
02:21:35.280 FastTrack bonus is only for the first
02:21:37.040 888 people who join today. Look, this is
02:21:39.520 a very hands-on program. I can only
02:21:41.120 coach so many people at the same time. I
02:21:42.720 cannot do this with everyone, and this
02:21:44.160 is not for everyone. You know, some
02:21:46.160 people want to go at their own pace and
02:21:47.680 they want to go the do it your uh
02:21:49.120 do-it-yourself approach. Okay, this
02:21:50.720 isn't relevant to them and that's fine.
02:21:52.319 Okay, but I know that there's at least
02:21:54.319 888 souls on the line here today that
02:21:57.200 would kill for an opportunity like this.
02:21:58.640 And considering everything you're
02:21:59.840 getting plus my track record of creating
02:22:01.520 success stories,
02:22:03.439 uh I'm going to go ahead and open Mai's
02:22:07.120 uh spots in just a second. So once the
02:22:09.520 number gets close to 888, I will give
02:22:12.080 you a warning and I'm going to be very
02:22:13.359 clear with you. We might reach it before
02:22:14.960 the end of this call. We might not. I
02:22:16.640 can't predict the future. But I will
02:22:17.920 tell you this, the last time I made this
02:22:19.600 available, the spots expired in less
02:22:21.040 than 8 minutes. Considering the number
02:22:22.479 of people we have here at this time,
02:22:24.319 it'll probably go even faster. And if it
02:22:26.000 does, I will let you know. And by the
02:22:27.359 way, the moment it does, we are going to
02:22:28.960 go uh uh we are going to go into the
02:22:30.960 checkout page and we're going to delete
02:22:32.640 it from the checkout page. Okay? So,
02:22:34.479 once I give you the URL, if it's still
02:22:36.319 there by the time you check out, that
02:22:37.680 means that you still have it, but you
02:22:38.960 have to hurry up because it might be
02:22:40.000 gone any minute. So, finally, let's
02:22:42.640 break down everything you get. First,
02:22:44.319 you get our four-step system to get your

02:24:06.640 just on the things you could buy
02:24:07.760 separately is $8,561.
02:24:10.160 That's just taking everything if you had
02:24:11.760 to buy it separately. Not to mention all
02:24:13.520 the other stuff that you couldn't buy.
02:24:14.960 Okay, so at $5,000, this is an

02:25:08.800 I'm dropping in the live chat in three,

02:25:28.960 one partnership today because in a few
02:25:30.880 weeks from now you could be launching
02:25:32.080 your first creator and getting sales
02:25:33.520 while everyone else is still trying to
02:25:35.359 figure out everything out on their own.
02:25:37.040 Now, on top of all of that, I want to
02:25:39.120 offer you an insane guarantee to back
02:25:40.960 this up. This is a better than money
02:25:42.479 guarantee. It is a work with you until
02:25:44.240 you win guarantee. Here's how it works.
02:25:46.000 You don't just get access to all the
02:25:47.520 tools and the systems. You get me and my
02:25:49.520 team committed to working with you.
02:25:51.359 Until you close your first creator
02:25:52.800 partnership or you make at least a 10x
02:25:54.720 return on investment. Not until you feel
02:25:56.560 ready. Not until you understand
02:25:57.760 everything. Until you actually land a
02:25:59.439 creator and have a partnership that pays
02:26:01.120 you and pays you well. If it takes 3
02:26:03.040 months, we're there. If it takes 6
02:26:04.319 months, we're there. If it takes a year,
02:26:05.600 we are still there. Throughout this
02:26:07.200 entire time, we keep giving you updates,
02:26:09.280 new training, new support, new
02:26:10.640 strategies, more done for you. Exactly
02:26:14.080 like we've done to our current users
02:26:16.160 three times last year. And by the way, I
02:26:18.240 just gave you my word for it. Now, let
02:26:19.760 me show you my actions because what I
02:26:21.359 have done for our monetized users, no
02:26:23.280 one else in this industry can ever say
02:26:24.800 they did. Okay? Recently, we discovered
02:26:26.720 a new method uh that gets digital
02:26:28.560 product sales insanely fast. We could
02:26:30.720 have taken that new method and charged
02:26:32.479 it as a $2,000 upsell for our current
02:26:34.399 customers. And I know thousands of them
02:26:36.000 would have taken it, but what did I tell
02:26:37.439 you? I'm not going to charge you for
02:26:38.800 updates until you succeed. So, instead,
02:26:40.479 what did I do? I hosted an entire
02:26:42.560 four-week workshop within the Monetize
02:26:44.240 community breaking down this method
02:26:46.000 during a [ __ ] ton of live sessions
02:26:47.600 completely free. And by the way, you can
02:26:48.800 even watch the recordings of this when
02:26:50.880 you join. Every single one of our users
02:26:53.439 who joined Monetize in January 2025, one
02:26:56.080 year ago, they got the alpha version of
02:26:58.160 Synthesize for $995. Since then, the
02:27:01.280 software has undergone two complete
02:27:02.960 overhauls. Okay? We've added dozens of
02:27:05.040 our new features that weren't promised.
02:27:06.560 The 2.0, the 3.0 version, which already
02:27:08.720 made an entirely new software, now even
02:27:10.319 the 4.0. Okay, now we're at the 4.0
02:27:12.640 version with all the shadow operating
02:27:14.319 modules. And every single one of our
02:27:16.319 original clients got the 2.0, the 3.0,
02:27:18.800 and the 4.0 versions for free. And by
02:27:22.640 the way, clients were in awe when they
02:27:24.880 got access to all this for free because
02:27:26.880 this is the exact same version listed
02:27:28.880 for $2,999.
02:27:30.720 And they got it all at no extra charge.
02:27:33.359 Okay. Ghost Riders, a ghost rider, I
02:27:35.520 have to pay almost $100,000 a month in
02:27:37.520 licensing fees. I pay per seat. The
02:27:39.760 original users of Monetize weren't
02:27:41.600 promised this yet. I still gave it to
02:27:43.840 them all for free. And once again, those
02:27:46.240 were thousands of seats that I had to
02:27:47.840 pay for. Then I created the shadow
02:27:49.680 operating playbook. Okay. Was that
02:27:51.520 included in the original offer that we
02:27:53.439 launched? No. I could have easily sold
02:27:55.200 her for $1,500 like I've done tens of
02:27:57.600 thousands of times with my previous
02:27:58.800 programs. So, what did I do instead? I
02:28:00.560 gave it to all of our monetized users
02:28:02.399 for free. Then I acquired a company
02:28:05.200 called Consulting.com. That is our
02:28:07.280 previous headquarters, our previous
02:28:08.560 office in uh Manhattan. Now, at the time
02:28:11.200 I acquire acquired it, their flagship
02:28:13.280 program sold for $1,997.
02:28:16.160 Over 20,000 customers had paid them that
02:28:18.880 amount for this program. Over $690
02:28:21.680 million earned by students and 52
02:28:24.240 millionaires created out of it. I paid
02:28:26.319 $1.7 million out of pocket for this
02:28:28.880 intellectual property. Here's the
02:28:30.240 receipt. Okay. Before I acquired it,
02:28:32.399 they'd made almost $80 million in sales.
02:28:35.200 Okay. Since I acquired it and since I
02:28:37.439 paid $1.7 million for it, do you know
02:28:39.280 how many times I sold this $2,000
02:28:41.040 program after the acquisition? Zero.
02:28:43.600 Instead, I gave it away to all my
02:28:45.120 customers for free. Just a few weeks
02:28:47.200 ago, a few of my pro users had a 90 a
02:28:49.680 90-day consulting package that came to
02:28:51.600 an end. And what did I do? I renewed
02:28:53.760 their package for every single one of
02:28:55.280 them that hadn't made a 10x return on
02:28:57.040 their investment for another 90 days
02:28:58.800 just to make sure that they are taken
02:29:00.160 care of. And these are just a few of the
02:29:02.240 recent examples. So, when I say we work
02:29:03.840 with you until you win, I mean it. And
02:29:05.920 as I always say, what you need is the
02:29:08.560 ability to create money on demand. The
02:29:10.399 skill of turning a creator's audience
02:29:12.000 into dollars in your account. Because
02:29:13.359 once you have that skill, once you've
02:29:15.760 closed that first 25 to 50k partnership,
02:29:18.399 all of your problems disappear. You're
02:29:19.920 not worried about money anymore. You're
02:29:21.200 not stuck in the 9 to5 grind anymore if
02:29:22.880 you don't want to. You get to make
02:29:24.399 decisions from a place of abundance, not
02:29:26.240 necessity. And that's worth infinitely
02:29:28.080 more than $1,995.
02:29:30.240 That is why the guarantee isn't get your
02:29:32.240 money back if it doesn't work. The
02:29:33.439 guarantee is we work with you until it
02:29:35.439 does. Period. It's simple. You have to
02:29:38.080 close your first creator partnership and
02:29:39.520 10x your investment or we keep working
02:29:41.439 with you until you do. Because remember,
02:29:43.280 with this business, you only need to get
02:29:44.880 this right once. All it takes is one
02:29:46.399 partnership to completely change your
02:29:47.760 entire life situation to achieve what I
02:29:49.600 call your turning point. You see, from
02:29:51.840 everything I've accomplished so far,
02:29:53.520 what I am the proudest of is helping
02:29:55.439 thousands of people start their online
02:29:56.960 business and throughout that achieve
02:29:58.560 their turning point. That is the point
02:30:00.800 in time where their income from their
02:30:02.640 online business surpasses their main
02:30:04.240 income stream and covers all of their uh
02:30:06.640 living expenses. Usually whenever
02:30:08.640 someone buys one of my digital products,
02:30:10.319 they are in one of two situations. Okay?
02:30:12.800 They are either working a job or
02:30:14.560 studying somewhere where they have
02:30:15.840 little to no prospect of financial
02:30:17.359 growth. They know that's not what they
02:30:18.720 want to be doing, but they are stuck at
02:30:19.920 that job or at college or uni with the
02:30:22.240 responsibilities that stop them from
02:30:23.600 simply quitting. or they're already
02:30:26.000 working very well- paid jobs. Sometimes
02:30:28.000 self-employed or small business owners,
02:30:29.920 you know, they're making great money,
02:30:31.040 but they simply can't enjoy the fruits
02:30:32.560 of their label, uh, fruits of their
02:30:34.160 labor, I should say, as they wish
02:30:36.000 because their work takes all of their
02:30:37.600 time, and they are stuck to that
02:30:39.040 physical location. The point here is
02:30:40.880 this, in both circumstances, they feel
02:30:42.960 as if someone else is in control of
02:30:44.560 their lives. They feel trapped in a life
02:30:46.640 controlled by others while watching
02:30:48.000 their true potential slip away. And this
02:30:49.920 turning point I mentioned is such a
02:30:51.680 pivotal moment for them because when
02:30:53.040 they achieve that, that is the moment
02:30:54.560 they get to reclaim ownership of their
02:30:56.000 lives. It is the moment they get to
02:30:57.520 choose what they will do now. If they're
02:30:59.280 going to fire their boss, if they're
02:31:00.399 going to quit uh uh sorry, if they're
02:31:01.920 going to, you know, fire their boss,
02:31:03.600 quit university, stop having to respond
02:31:05.439 to someone else. They get to decide
02:31:06.960 because they are now the ones in
02:31:08.160 control. And there's nothing more
02:31:09.439 liberating than experiencing this
02:31:10.880 transformation in your own life. I
02:31:12.720 experienced that myself when I was able
02:31:14.479 to quit school and look my mom in the
02:31:16.240 eyes and tell her, &quot;Don't worry, I got
02:31:17.840 you.&quot; And I truly believe that in 2026,
02:31:20.000 the best and the fastest way to achieve
02:31:21.520 your turning point is by becoming a
02:31:23.200 shadow operator. The last time I opened
02:31:25.040 this offer, I helped thousands of
02:31:27.040 regular everyday people achieve their
02:31:28.640 turning point. And now I'm ready to do
02:31:30.640 that again and create a legion of shadow
02:31:32.399 operators. So, are you willing to join
02:31:34.560 me on this mission to become a shadow
02:31:36.479 operator and join me in building this
02:31:38.640 legion of successful individuals who
02:31:40.720 will achieve their turning points? So,
02:31:43.040 really, you only have two options.
02:31:45.200 Either you succeed and close your first
02:31:47.120 creator partnership or we keep working
02:31:49.680 with you until you do. The only way to
02:31:51.760 lose is by not giving it a try. And in
02:31:54.000 addition to that, your investment is
02:31:55.680 also protected with a 7-day full refund
02:31:57.920 policy. Meaning, if for any reason you
02:31:59.600 don't like what you get inside Monetize,
02:32:01.120 you have 7 days to get 100% of your
02:32:03.120 money back. All you need to do is email
02:32:04.800 support and monetize and ask for a
02:32:06.319 refund and it will get processed with no
02:32:08.240 questions asked within 48 hours. With
02:32:10.479 this, I am literally taking all the risk
02:32:12.319 of our deal here on me. I couldn't
02:32:14.160 possibly t be taking on any more risk on
02:32:16.479 my side. You don't have any risk on your
02:32:18.640 side here today. And by the way, just a
02:32:21.040 heads up, if you have any issues
02:32:22.479 checking out, our team is going to reach
02:32:24.240 out to you within 5 minutes using the
02:32:25.920 contact information that you put on the
02:32:27.920 checkout page. So, please keep an eye
02:32:29.520 out on your WhatsApp or SMS for that.
02:32:31.680 So, that way you are guaranteed to get
02:32:33.520 your first creator partnership and 10x
02:32:35.120 your investment or we will keep working
02:32:37.040 with you until you do. Which means the
02:32:38.880 only way this this investment doesn't
02:32:40.640 pay off is if you don't take action. And
02:32:42.560 by the way, just a heads up, if finances
02:32:44.240 are tight for you right now, get this.
02:32:45.840 We have the best third-party financing
02:32:47.600 for you that the market has ever seen.
02:32:49.359 Why? To make this accessible to anyone
02:32:51.200 who is serious about changing their
02:32:52.479 situation. And because we process
02:32:54.160 everything through WP, which I'm a
02:32:55.439 co-owner of, this gives us data that
02:32:57.359 most uh people simply don't have. We are
02:32:59.600 able to offer financing plans that
02:33:01.280 literally no one else can. We are
02:33:03.040 talking about breaking this down into
02:33:04.399 manageable payments that anyone can
02:33:05.840 afford. You can check the financing
02:33:07.520 options in the checkout page or the link
02:33:09.280 pinned in the live comments or at
02:33:11.200 joineman.com. Guys, I could keep going
02:33:13.680 on forever here, but we are over time
02:33:16.319 already. And we have Jason who is here
02:33:18.319 to start going through some of the
02:33:20.319 Q&amp;As's. Plus, if we have time, we have
02:33:23.760 some very, very special guests who might
02:33:25.439 join as I said if time allow allows
02:33:27.600 after this main session. So, I just want
02:33:29.840 to leave you with one last message here.
02:33:31.680 Closing a single creator partnership is
02:33:33.920 all you need to get to decide what you
02:33:36.240 work, where you work from, when you
02:33:37.920 work, or even if you want to work in the
02:33:39.600 first place. To no longer stress about
02:33:41.200 money, to reclaim ownership of your
02:33:42.720 life, and be the one dictating the shots
02:33:44.399 again. You are only one partnership away
02:33:46.800 from the life that you have always
02:33:48.000 dreamed of. And with that being said,
02:33:50.000 now it is time for our Q&amp;A.
