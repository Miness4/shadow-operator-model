00:00:00.400 Good to go. Lovely. Lovely. All right.
00:00:04.240 As I said yesterday, we had a few uh
00:00:06.960 errors here and there, but good news is
00:00:08.639 none of that matters because if you can
00:00:10.400 understand what I'm about to show you
00:00:11.519 here today, this business is the most
00:00:13.360 profitable thing that you will see in
00:00:14.799 decades. And it's where all the smart
00:00:16.640 money goes. But as I said previously,
00:00:18.720 this was only available to a select few.
00:00:20.800 And because of AI, it is now possible
00:00:23.279 for all of you. Okay. By the end of
00:00:25.439 today's session, I'm going to eliminate
00:00:26.720 every doubt you have about your ability
00:00:29.439 to land shadow operating partnerships,
00:00:31.199 and you will have the exact plan to go
00:00:32.800 from zero to your first shadow operating
00:00:34.800 partnership. I'm going to show you
00:00:36.239 exactly how to find the right creators,
00:00:37.840 not just any creators, how to approach
00:00:39.440 them, so that way they're excited to
00:00:40.960 work with you, why they will say yes
00:00:42.800 even if you're a complete beginner, and
00:00:44.480 the biggest mistakes that could cause
00:00:45.840 you to fail. So that way you can avoid
00:00:47.840 them. And if you attended our session
00:00:49.360 yesterday, you also saw the special
00:00:50.960 offer that we made. And it is insane to
00:00:53.440 say to see that inside of Mis, we have
00:00:55.920 clients who are already landing their
00:00:57.360 first shadow operating partners already
00:00:59.600 in the first week of January. Just like
00:01:01.760 Kim here, who literally just posted that
00:01:04.559 he made his first $2,800 with shadow
00:01:07.439 operating. Look, it's what I said
00:01:09.680 yesterday. While 99% of people watched
00:01:11.840 from the sidelines, the 1% that will
00:01:13.520 make 2026 the greatest year of their
00:01:15.280 lives are already taking action. And if
00:01:18.320 you've been interested in what I showed
00:01:19.600 you yesterday, chances are that you are
00:01:21.200 going to love today's fast action time
00:01:23.840 limited bonus even more than the one we
00:01:26.000 shared yesterday. But you can be the
00:01:28.080 judge of it when we show it to you
00:01:29.439 later. All I can say is I might have
00:01:31.119 gone overboard with today's bonus
00:01:33.040 because people have paid millions and
00:01:34.880 millions of dollars for it. This bonus
00:01:36.880 is something that we are only going to
00:01:38.159 make available for the people who have
00:01:40.159 already signed up for MAI. And the
00:01:42.159 people who sign up for Metize before the
00:01:44.320 end of today's presentation. So if you
00:01:46.320 join monetize already, congratulations.
00:01:48.399 You will get airdrop this. And if you
00:01:50.000 join before the end of today's session,
00:01:51.920 you will get this massive, massive bonus
00:01:54.000 that people have already paid millions
00:01:56.079 of dollars for. So
00:01:58.479 to end, as usual, at the end of today's
00:02:00.479 live training, we are going to have a
00:02:01.840 more informal session answering all of
00:02:03.600 your questions with my very special
00:02:05.360 co-host, Jason Fladlin. My main focus
00:02:07.680 here today is to help you close your
00:02:09.199 first shadow operating partnership.
00:02:10.959 Okay, Jason, just to give you a bit of
00:02:12.800 context, he's been in this industry for
00:02:14.640 20 years at this point and he sold over
00:02:16.879 100 million via shadow operation during
00:02:19.120 that time. But let's get to that all in
00:02:21.599 due time. Before I tell you what to do,
00:02:23.520 let me first tell you what not to do,
00:02:25.280 okay? Because here's the thing. There is
00:02:26.959 nothing I can tell you that will 100%
00:02:28.959 guarantee success. That's just the
00:02:30.239 nature of anything you do in life. But
00:02:32.160 there are a few things that you can do
00:02:33.360 that will 100% guarantee failure. more
00:02:35.599 specifically three deadly mistakes that
00:02:37.360 most people make when trying to close
00:02:38.959 their first shadow operating
00:02:40.000 partnership. And if you make one of
00:02:41.519 those, you are not going to get that
00:02:43.120 first yes that you are looking for. And
00:02:44.879 by far the main reason people fail and
00:02:46.800 give up on this business, which I
00:02:48.160 consider to be the best business model
00:02:49.920 for 2026, is simply because they can't
00:02:52.400 seem to get that first yes. So, if we
00:02:55.680 can eliminate the top three reasons why
00:02:57.360 most people fail here, well, then don't
00:02:59.280 you think your odds of succeeding would
00:03:00.959 increase exponentially? The truth is
00:03:02.959 with business, you just need a business
00:03:04.560 that allows you to fail for a long
00:03:06.159 enough time without burning through all
00:03:08.000 of your savings or running out of tries.
00:03:10.480 And that is exactly what shadow
00:03:11.840 operating allows you today uh to do. You
00:03:14.159 get unlimited tries. And if one doesn't
00:03:16.080 work, that's fine. Nothing happens. You
00:03:18.159 are still in the game. You are the only
00:03:20.239 way to fail with this business is if you
00:03:22.640 stop trying. So if we can stop these
00:03:24.959 three deadly mistakes that make people
00:03:26.480 stop trying. Are you willing to give it
00:03:28.239 a try? If that's the case, well then
00:03:30.080 perfect. Now, not only will we eliminate
00:03:32.799 these three mistakes, but I'm also going
00:03:34.560 to show you the three shadow operating
00:03:36.080 partnership principles you need to
00:03:37.599 follow to close your first shadow
00:03:39.200 operating partnership. Finally, once you
00:03:42.159 understand all of those, I'm going to
00:03:43.360 give you the 30-day road map on what on
00:03:45.440 exactly what to execute over the next 30
00:03:47.440 days. And I'm going to show you what is
00:03:48.799 possible to achieve with this business,
00:03:50.720 short, medium, and long term. Now, let
00:03:53.200 me know if you are ready by typing a yes
00:03:55.200 in the chat, and I will have a nice sip
00:03:59.280 of tea.
00:04:05.599 All right, seems like you guys are fired
00:04:07.120 up. Okay, look, the number one mistake,
00:04:10.239 okay, is going after the wrong creators.
00:04:12.080 Here is a rule of thumb. We already
00:04:13.920 talked about this briefly yesterday, but
00:04:15.680 you do not want to go for the creators
00:04:17.199 with 1, two, 5, 7 million followers.
00:04:19.680 Those are not the creators that we are
00:04:21.040 looking for here. two years from now
00:04:22.800 when you've been doing this for a while
00:04:24.240 and you've done 10 or 20 partnerships
00:04:25.919 and you become really good at at what it
00:04:27.919 is that you are doing that is a
00:04:29.440 different story then you can go for
00:04:30.960 these big creators but now when you are
00:04:32.720 first starting out they are a no-go okay
00:04:34.960 I see a lot of people doing this because
00:04:36.479 it looks impressive right and in their
00:04:38.400 minds a bigger audience equals bigger
00:04:40.240 money at least that's what they think
00:04:41.919 now you're going to see in just a second
00:04:43.440 why that's not actually true okay here's
00:04:46.240 why this a bad idea these creators have
00:04:48.479 products they have teams they have
00:04:49.840 existing partnerships they have a whole
00:04:51.280 operation ation in place already. Now,
00:04:53.280 this situation is drastically different
00:04:55.360 when we're talking about micro creators.
00:04:57.040 If you paid attention to yesterday's
00:04:58.560 session, microcreators are people with
00:05:00.479 10,000 to 100,000 followers. Let's say
00:05:02.400 you're reaching out to one with 40,000
00:05:04.000 followers. A creator with 40,000
00:05:05.680 followers in general has no team, no
00:05:08.080 partnerships. They get maybe 5 to 10 DMs
00:05:10.320 a week about business inquiries, if even
00:05:12.240 that, by the way. And most of them are
00:05:13.600 simple sponsored posts, and they simply
00:05:15.680 don't know how to monetize properly. And
00:05:17.600 they are desperate to make more money
00:05:19.520 from their following.
00:05:21.759 they have no operation. Do you
00:05:23.360 understand the difference? And that
00:05:24.479 leads us directly to our next mistake.
00:05:26.400 Believing that you need to improve what
00:05:27.919 they are currently uh doing. Okay,
00:05:29.919 here's why this is completely wrong way
00:05:31.600 to think about things. Okay, this is the
00:05:33.840 biggest mental block I see is actually
00:05:35.840 [ __ ] up with people's ability to
00:05:37.440 actually take action. People think, how
00:05:39.759 can I improve what they have? The answer
00:05:41.600 is you are not improving anything. Okay,
00:05:43.840 they have nothing. There's nothing to
00:05:45.520 improve on. Think about it like this.
00:05:48.000 Let's say you meet someone who's been
00:05:49.199 sleeping on the floor for years and
00:05:51.280 you're sitting there, you know, anxious
00:05:52.960 and nervous thinking, well, how can I
00:05:54.560 give them a better mattress than what
00:05:55.840 they currently have, but you need to
00:05:57.600 understand, they don't have a mattress.
00:05:58.720 They're literally sleeping on the floor.
00:06:00.080 So, even if you give them a mediocre
00:06:01.840 mattress, like a three out of 10
00:06:03.199 mattress, that is infinitely better than
00:06:05.600 sleeping on the floor. These micro
00:06:07.280 creators, they're basically sleeping on
00:06:08.800 the floor, okay? They have no digital
00:06:10.319 products, they have no launch strategy,
00:06:12.319 they have no monetization system, and
00:06:14.080 they have no way to make real money
00:06:15.520 beyond brand deals. So when you come in
00:06:17.520 with your game plan, your product
00:06:18.880 outline, your launch sequence, when you
00:06:20.720 come in with all of that, even if it's a
00:06:22.479 three out of 10 operation, that is
00:06:24.319 infinitely better than what they have
00:06:25.919 right now, which once again is nothing.
00:06:28.000 Okay? The anxiety of why would they
00:06:29.840 trust me to do better than they're
00:06:31.039 currently doing is non is a non-existent
00:06:33.280 problem because they are not doing
00:06:34.720 anything. So literally anything is
00:06:36.880 already better than what they have. Do
00:06:38.639 you understand how this mental shift
00:06:40.400 completely changes how you approach this
00:06:42.000 partnership? Can you at least grasp the
00:06:44.000 idea that you don't need to improve
00:06:45.680 anything? Because if you can get that,
00:06:47.440 you can close a partnership. Now, our
00:06:49.520 final mistake here is trying to sell
00:06:51.440 these creators into partnership as if
00:06:53.280 you're pitching them to become your
00:06:54.720 clients. That is the completely wrong
00:06:56.479 approach to what we are doing here. You
00:06:58.400 see, when it comes to closing shadow
00:06:59.919 operating deals, there is no selling
00:07:01.919 involved. Okay? At no point in time does
00:07:04.319 the creator need to pay you a fee or
00:07:06.160 retainer. And because there's no payment
00:07:08.000 involved, there's no need to sell them
00:07:09.840 anything. Here is what you need to
00:07:11.599 understand. These creators have a
00:07:13.280 problem. You You have a solution. The
00:07:16.080 only thing you need to do is figure out
00:07:17.919 if if this solution you have can
00:07:20.319 actually help them. What we're doing
00:07:21.919 here is way sim is pretty similar to
00:07:23.919 basically what a doctor does. A doctor
00:07:26.080 isn't trying to sell you medicine. A
00:07:27.919 doctor talks to you. They diagnose what
00:07:29.759 your problem is and they prescribe a
00:07:31.440 solution. And the solution doesn't
00:07:32.880 necessarily include buying medicine.
00:07:35.039 Just like in our case, our solution does
00:07:36.800 not include the creator having to spend
00:07:38.160 a single scent to get this running. All
00:07:40.400 you need is their commitment. Their
00:07:42.160 commitment to post the stories uh that
00:07:44.240 you are actually going to create for
00:07:45.599 them. Okay? And you need to understand
00:07:47.520 they're already creating or already
00:07:49.199 posting these stories, I should say. You
00:07:50.960 just need their commitment to be a
00:07:52.240 little bit more strategic about the
00:07:53.919 stories that they are posting for that
00:07:55.520 14-day sequence. That's it. Okay? It's
00:07:57.919 like offering someone a GPS when they're
00:07:59.599 already driving to a destination.
00:08:01.039 Listen, they're already making the trip.
00:08:02.639 Okay? You're just helping them make it a
00:08:04.400 little bit more efficient. All you need
00:08:06.319 is their commitment to follow the turns.
00:08:08.240 That is what we're doing here. When you
00:08:09.840 have a clear niche, a painful problem,
00:08:11.440 and a valuable solution, you don't need
00:08:13.120 to sell them because they are already
00:08:14.720 sold on it in the first place. Okay? And
00:08:16.720 I'm going to show you how to dial in
00:08:17.840 these three elements in just a second.
00:08:19.599 But for now, just think about it. If
00:08:21.520 someone is bleeding on the street, do
00:08:23.199 you need to sell them going to the
00:08:24.800 hospital? No. That's obvious. Your job
00:08:27.120 isn't to convince them that they are
00:08:28.479 bleeding. Your job is to show them that
00:08:30.319 you have the ambulance. If we bring it
00:08:32.000 back to creators, these microcreators,
00:08:34.080 they are bleeding. They are working
00:08:35.599 full-time jobs while building audiences,
00:08:37.839 getting two to five sponsorship uh
00:08:39.440 sponsorship posts per month at like $250
00:08:42.080 a pop, okay? Spending 20 hours a week
00:08:44.159 creating content for a few hundred bucks
00:08:45.839 a month and then watching their
00:08:47.120 followers grow while their bank account
00:08:49.279 stays flat. The pain is real. Like
00:08:52.480 genuinely real. I have talked to
00:08:54.240 hundreds of these creators and they are
00:08:55.680 all going through the same thing. They
00:08:57.600 already want a solution to their
00:08:59.360 problem. You can clearly see in the
00:09:01.279 dozens of DMs that I've been getting
00:09:02.720 from creators. Notice the wording. I'm
00:09:05.120 struggling with monetization. I would
00:09:07.040 like to partner with someone to help me
00:09:08.720 build out my uh digital ecosystem or
00:09:11.360 things like, oh, I just want to focus on
00:09:13.040 content, not on back-end stuff. They
00:09:15.360 already have they already uh sorry, they
00:09:17.120 were already convinced that they need
00:09:18.399 help. You just need to show them that
00:09:19.920 you understand their problem. Show them
00:09:21.360 the opportunity they're missing, and
00:09:22.880 show them that you have a system to put
00:09:24.640 into practice. Okay, so those are the
00:09:27.600 three biggest mistakes. going after the
00:09:29.519 wrong creators, thinking that you need
00:09:31.120 to improve what they have and lastly
00:09:33.120 trying to sell them. You shouldn't do
00:09:34.560 that. Okay? Avoid those three things and
00:09:36.720 you're already ahead of 90% of people
00:09:38.880 who try this. And I am not exaggerating.
00:09:41.040 Most people [ __ ] up at least one of
00:09:42.480 these, usually all three. Do you think
00:09:44.720 that you could avoid these three
00:09:45.920 mistakes now that I have laid out
00:09:47.440 clearly to you? If you can,
00:09:49.680 congratulations. You are already 90% of
00:09:52.480 your way to your first shadow operating
00:09:54.240 partnership. So, let me show you what to
00:09:57.360 actually do. Now, before going any
00:09:59.200 further, there's one thing I want to
00:10:00.640 address because I know exactly what some
00:10:02.640 of you guys are thinking. You're
00:10:03.760 thinking, &quot;Hey, man, this sounds all
00:10:05.120 great, but you know, let's say, for
00:10:06.160 example, my Instagram, it looks like
00:10:07.279 garbage. How am I going to reach out to
00:10:08.320 these creators like this? I don't have
00:10:09.760 nice pictures. I only have 42 followers.
00:10:11.519 My last post was from 2019. How would
00:10:13.600 any creator take me seriously?&quot; And
00:10:14.959 look, I get it. This is probably the
00:10:16.079 number one concern I hear from people
00:10:17.360 getting into shadow operating. So, let
00:10:19.279 me break this down for you because here
00:10:20.560 is what you need to understand. You are
00:10:22.240 not trying to become an influencer. you
00:10:23.600 are not trying to impress them with your
00:10:24.800 social media game, okay? Think about it
00:10:26.399 like this. You or or sorry, they are
00:10:28.720 dying of thirst uh in the desert, okay?
00:10:31.040 And someone shows up with a bottle of
00:10:32.399 water. Are you going to complain that
00:10:33.760 the bottle of water doesn't have the
00:10:35.760 best packaging? Are you going to ask,
00:10:36.880 &quot;Excuse me, was this water sourced from
00:10:38.640 the Himalayan springs or is this uh oh,
00:10:41.360 I won't drink this because this is
00:10:42.720 plastic and this isn't from a bottle.&quot;
00:10:44.160 No. Okay. You're going to say, &quot;Thank
00:10:45.760 you. Give me the water.&quot; That is the
00:10:47.600 position you're in as a shadow operator.
00:10:49.279 These creators are desperate for
00:10:51.040 monetization. Okay? They're struggling
00:10:52.399 to turn their following into real income
00:10:54.480 and you have the tools to solve their
00:10:56.399 pro problem. They don't care if your
00:10:58.240 profile picture is from 5 years ago.
00:11:00.079 They don't care if you have 12
00:11:01.279 followers. In many ways, not looking
00:11:03.040 button up and professional on Instagram
00:11:04.560 is actually your advantage. Why? Because
00:11:06.480 you're a shadow operator. Okay? You're
00:11:07.760 meant to stay in the [ __ ] shadows.
00:11:09.040 You're not meant to compete with them.
00:11:10.320 Okay? If you have only a few followers
00:11:12.160 and you aren't very active on Instagram,
00:11:13.839 it means you're not trying to, you know,
00:11:15.839 become some influencer, some Tik Tok
00:11:17.600 dancing monkey, okay? It means you're
00:11:19.440 not trying to steal their followers or
00:11:21.120 overshadow them. Okay? You are there to
00:11:23.279 make the money. Okay? That's it. And if
00:11:25.680 your Instagram profile screams, &quot;Oh, I'm
00:11:27.360 marketing expert with 50,000 followers.&quot;
00:11:28.880 That might actually intimidate them.
00:11:30.160 Okay? They might think, &quot;Why does this
00:11:31.519 person even need to work with me?&quot; But
00:11:32.959 when you show up as someone with a
00:11:34.399 modest profile who clearly has the
00:11:35.920 determination and the tools to help
00:11:37.200 them, that is a perfect combination.
00:11:39.040 You're not you're non-threatening and
00:11:40.720 you are valuable, and that's exactly
00:11:41.920 what they're looking for. Now, does this
00:11:43.600 mean that you should have a profile that
00:11:44.800 makes you look like a complete fool? No,
00:11:46.399 of course not. If your picture or
00:11:47.839 profile is blurry, maybe updated. If
00:11:49.519 your Instagram says something weird or
00:11:50.800 outdated, maybe clean it up. And we're
00:11:52.399 talking about basic stuff here. Look,
00:11:54.160 this is basically an example of what
00:11:55.200 good enough is, okay? A clear profile
00:11:57.839 picture. It doesn't need to be a
00:11:59.120 professional headshot, by the way. And a
00:12:00.880 simple bio that says something like
00:12:02.079 helping creators monetize their audience
00:12:03.600 or even just your name and what you are
00:12:05.200 interested in. That's it. Okay? You
00:12:06.800 don't need thousands of followers, a
00:12:08.160 highlight reel of achievements, perfect
00:12:09.600 pictures, or verification badge. None of
00:12:11.279 that matters. What matters is the value
00:12:13.120 that you bring to the table. What
00:12:14.399 matters is the game plan you bring to
00:12:15.680 them. If your monetization game plan is
00:12:17.519 on point, they will respond. I've seen
00:12:19.440 people with less than 100 followers land
00:12:21.040 15,000 partnerships. Why? Because the
00:12:22.959 creators saw the value in what it is
00:12:24.800 that they're offering. Not the
00:12:26.079 packaging, the value. So, stop worrying
00:12:28.240 about your Instagram profile. Stop
00:12:29.760 letting that be the excuse that holds
00:12:31.519 you back. The message is more important
00:12:33.519 than the messenger. And if you follow
00:12:35.279 everything I'm teaching you here, your
00:12:36.800 message is going to be impossible to
00:12:38.560 ignore. So, let me ask you, does it make
00:12:41.040 sense to you that people with less than
00:12:42.399 100 followers have landed $15,000
00:12:44.480 partnerships because the value of their
00:12:45.920 monet monetization game plan was simply
00:12:48.639 impossible to ignore? Doesn't that then
00:12:51.040 prove that the message matters
00:12:52.560 infinitely more than your follower
00:12:53.920 count? So, are you really going to let
00:12:56.000 something as trivial as your Instagram
00:12:57.920 aesthetic stop you from helping creators
00:12:59.680 make money and earn life-changing income
00:13:01.680 yourself? I'm sure you won't. Now,
00:13:04.880 moving on. It's now that you or I should
00:13:07.519 say now that you understand the three
00:13:08.959 partnership killers. Okay, we can move
00:13:10.480 on to the next thing. This is the exact
00:13:12.880 system we implemented with all of our
00:13:14.480 clients inside multis. It is very
00:13:16.079 simple. Okay, step number one, avoid the
00:13:18.160 three partnership killers. Step number
00:13:19.600 two, follow the three partnership
00:13:20.880 princip uh principles. Step number
00:13:22.800 three, implement implement the 30-day
00:13:24.639 plan. Now, I'm going to show you these
00:13:26.399 three principles in detail. And when you
00:13:28.160 implement them, you're going to see a
00:13:29.600 dramatic improvement in the number of
00:13:31.120 yeses you get from creators. Sometimes
00:13:33.360 even within your first few attempts.
00:13:35.360 Now, for some people, it happens in
00:13:36.959 their very first contact after sending
00:13:38.880 the game plan. For others, it might take
00:13:40.880 two or three positive responses from the
00:13:42.720 game plans. But here is what I can
00:13:44.959 promise. If you follow this system
00:13:47.279 exactly as I show you, you will close a
00:13:49.200 partnership. Okay? It is just a matter
00:13:50.880 of when. It might take a few days. It
00:13:52.320 might take a few weeks. It might even
00:13:53.680 take a couple months. Okay? But I've yet
00:13:55.519 to see someone who is stuck at this for
00:13:57.120 more than 6 months and hasn't closed a
00:13:59.199 single partnership. As in a person
00:14:00.560 that's really truly committed to it,
00:14:02.320 okay? The system works. Your job is not
00:14:04.639 to figure it out. Your job is to follow
00:14:06.720 the system. Okay? Can you follow simple
00:14:09.519 step-by-step instructions? If you can,
00:14:11.760 congratulations. You can succeed with
00:14:13.600 this. Okay? And not only can you
00:14:15.680 succeed, you will close your first
00:14:17.760 creator partnership with this. So, let
00:14:19.839 me go ahead and show you partnership
00:14:21.519 principle one after I enjoy a nice sip
00:14:23.839 of tea.
00:14:28.480 So, the first time I actually came
00:14:30.320 across this principle was actually in an
00:14:31.920 online program called Consulting
00:14:33.360 Accelerator. You may have heard me talk
00:14:35.120 about this program before. For those of
00:14:36.720 you guys that don't know, Consulting
00:14:38.000 Accelerator is a legendary business
00:14:39.839 program that's helped more than 20,000
00:14:41.600 people start online businesses. It's
00:14:43.760 created 52 millionaires, hundreds of
00:14:45.760 six-figure earners, and over 620 million
00:14:48.480 or actually outdated numbers, actually
00:14:50.639 690 million, I should say, in earnings
00:14:53.120 from clients that went through it. It is
00:14:54.720 probably the most successful business
00:14:55.920 training program ever created and I went
00:14:57.600 through myself uh I went through it
00:14:59.120 myself back in the day and a lot of the
00:15:00.800 principles I teach today come from what
00:15:02.399 I learned in that program because shadow
00:15:03.920 operating is the new evolution of what
00:15:05.920 consulting was back then. So a lot of
00:15:07.920 those same principles apply to what
00:15:09.440 we're doing here and one of the most
00:15:10.800 powerful frameworks from consulting
00:15:12.399 accelerator is what's called the perfect
00:15:14.240 storm of variables. It all stems from
00:15:16.399 the idea that it is hard to be good at a
00:15:18.560 range of things. But it is surprisingly
00:15:20.320 easy to be great at one thing, which
00:15:22.480 matches perfectly with the rule of one,
00:15:24.639 the theme so far of our workshop. Okay,
00:15:27.199 so let me show you how this framework
00:15:28.560 from consulting accelerator can help you
00:15:30.480 nail down the one thing that you can be
00:15:32.399 great at and get paid very handsomely
00:15:34.480 for. The framework from consulting
00:15:36.160 accelerator teaches you three things
00:15:37.839 that need to align. industries or
00:15:39.839 markets you know or are interested in
00:15:41.920 the markets needs and desires and the
00:15:44.160 skills you have or can easily attain.
00:15:46.800 And here's where these three things
00:15:48.240 overlap. That is your gold mine. Okay,
00:15:50.880 so here's how you apply this to create
00:15:52.639 the exact positioning you need to close
00:15:54.480 your first shadow operating deal. First
00:15:56.399 question, what type of creators do you
00:15:57.920 already know or follow? For example,
00:15:59.440 fitness creators, parenting creators,
00:16:00.880 finance or investment creators, career
00:16:02.320 or productivity creators, relationship
00:16:04.160 coaches, food or cooking creators,
00:16:05.600 beauty or skin creators, mental health
00:16:07.279 or therapy creators. Okay, right now
00:16:09.279 grab a pen and paper. Write down five
00:16:10.959 different types of creators you either
00:16:12.639 follow and are interested in or have
00:16:14.639 some connection to. Write them down.
00:16:16.320 Please do not overthink it. Could be
00:16:17.839 anything. Got it? Good. These are the
00:16:20.079 industries that you know our first
00:16:21.600 circle. Now we go to the markets needs
00:16:23.600 and desires. This is the most important
00:16:25.199 variable. A massive breakthrough for me
00:16:27.519 when I went through consulting
00:16:28.720 accelerator was when I understood this.
00:16:30.639 The market's needs matter than your own
00:16:32.959 skills. Let me repeat that. The market's
00:16:34.720 needs matter more than your skills. Most
00:16:37.440 people think the most important thing is
00:16:39.279 their skills. And that is why some
00:16:40.880 people go to university for 10 years,
00:16:42.320 collect minors, majors, masters, PhDs,
00:16:44.800 you name it. And yet, they're still
00:16:46.639 broke. Why? Because the market doesn't
00:16:49.759 care about your qualifications. The
00:16:51.839 market doesn't care about your skills.
00:16:54.079 The only thing the market cares about is
00:16:56.399 solving their problems. Now, this made
00:17:00.000 me understand that if you don't have a
00:17:01.519 skill, it doesn't matter. You don't need
00:17:03.519 one to succeed here because the most
00:17:05.280 important circle in our framework here
00:17:07.760 is what does the market need for
00:17:09.599 microcreators? The needs are they need
00:17:12.079 to monetize their audience. They need
00:17:13.679 products to sell. They need a launch
00:17:15.359 strategy. They need to escape the
00:17:16.959 sponsorship hamster wheel. And they need
00:17:19.039 consistent income. Okay, this need is
00:17:21.520 universal across all microcreators. And
00:17:23.599 that is why this model works so well.
00:17:25.520 Every creator with 10 to 100,000
00:17:27.599 followers has the same core problem. I
00:17:29.760 have an audience, but how do I turn it
00:17:31.440 into real money? And here's where most
00:17:33.200 people get stuck. They think, &quot;But I
00:17:34.880 don't have the skills to help creators
00:17:36.160 monetize.&quot; And you're right to say that.
00:17:37.919 You see, one of the best pieces of
00:17:39.360 advice I got from Consulting Accelerator
00:17:41.039 was you don't need to have all the
00:17:42.640 skills already. You don't need to find a
00:17:44.480 niche or sorry, all you need to do is
00:17:46.559 find a niche, find a painful problem,
00:17:48.640 and then you acquire the least skills
00:17:50.480 necessary in order to solve it. Now, the
00:17:53.440 problem is historically acquiring these
00:17:55.760 skills would have taken years. Okay? uh
00:17:57.840 copywriting, product development,
00:17:59.200 marketing, it would have been a lot of
00:18:00.559 work for you to learn everything
00:18:01.760 yourself. But today, we live in a very
00:18:04.000 different environment. Okay? You don't
00:18:05.679 need to learn the skills anymore. In
00:18:07.120 fact, it would be dumb of you to spend
00:18:08.960 months or years trying to figure out how
00:18:10.640 to do this yourself because you can get
00:18:12.400 it all done for you with specialized AI
00:18:14.720 tools. The tools give you the skills.
00:18:16.640 They do the work for you. So that way,
00:18:19.200 you're not having to acquire the skills
00:18:20.960 through years and years of study. Okay?
00:18:23.039 You are leveraging specialized AI to do
00:18:25.360 the work for you. Okay? Just like you
00:18:27.520 don't try to learn how to cut your own
00:18:28.960 hair because why would you learn how to
00:18:30.480 cut your own hair? It's not worth your
00:18:32.000 time. And by the way, you would never do
00:18:33.679 it as well as a professional. So what do
00:18:35.440 you do? You go to a barber. The
00:18:37.120 difference here is that you don't even
00:18:38.559 need to hire someone to take care of
00:18:40.080 this task. You just get the AI to do it
00:18:42.080 for you. Do you see how through the use
00:18:44.240 of specialized AI, you can now offer
00:18:46.559 this to these creators and you can offer
00:18:48.559 them the exact solution to the problems
00:18:50.720 that they have. So that way when you
00:18:52.559 align the right type of creator, the
00:18:54.880 universal need which is which is
00:18:56.240 monetization and the right AI tools that
00:18:58.320 do it for you, you have what consulting
00:19:00.160 accelerator coined as the perfect storm
00:19:02.640 of variables. And when these three
00:19:04.480 variables come together, nothing can
00:19:06.559 stop you. It becomes virtually
00:19:08.000 impossible not to make money. So right
00:19:10.320 now you already know exactly what type
00:19:12.640 of creators to reach out to. You already
00:19:14.480 have a list of five different creator
00:19:15.919 topics that you're familiar with or
00:19:17.919 you're interested in. and you understand
00:19:19.600 these microcreators universal needs. Now
00:19:22.320 you also know how to use specialized AI
00:19:24.240 tools to do the specialized work for
00:19:26.640 you. So you basically have the perfect
00:19:28.799 alignment between the three circles.
00:19:30.880 Meaning you have all the raw materials
00:19:32.880 that you need to succeed with this. So
00:19:35.280 what's missing? Putting them into
00:19:37.039 practice. So let's talk exactly about
00:19:39.440 that. How to actually reach out to
00:19:41.440 creators. Okay, this is the second
00:19:43.360 principle and this completely uh changed
00:19:46.160 my approach and the way I looked at
00:19:47.520 outreach. Okay? Because it got me to
00:19:49.440 understand that outreach starts way
00:19:51.120 before you ever send any creator a
00:19:52.799 message. This principle also comes from
00:19:54.880 consulting accelerator and it's honestly
00:19:56.400 one of the most powerful things I
00:19:57.440 learned from the program. The principle
00:19:58.799 is success isn't about being talented or
00:20:01.280 skilled. It's just about hitting the
00:20:02.799 numbers. Let me show you what I mean in
00:20:04.240 practice. This is the exact system our
00:20:06.320 clients inside Monetize use to track
00:20:08.080 their shadow operating outreach efforts
00:20:09.760 in business. It's what's known as a
00:20:11.760 customer relationship manager or CRM for
00:20:14.000 short. And listen, if you don't know, I
00:20:15.760 also own one of the main CRM tools that
00:20:17.600 people use to track their outreach and
00:20:19.200 organize their entire shadow operating
00:20:20.960 business. The software is called Flozy,
00:20:23.120 which means I can literally see the
00:20:24.480 back-end numbers of what people are, you
00:20:26.720 know, need to hit in outreach in order
00:20:28.880 to sign partnerships. As I said, I have
00:20:30.960 real data from real people doing this in
00:20:33.120 real time. And after tracking over
00:20:35.120 20,000 outreach messages sent across
00:20:37.120 dozens of industries, here's what the
00:20:39.120 data shows us. On average, for every 100
00:20:41.360 messages you send, you get 10 to 15
00:20:43.360 responses. That gets 5 to 10 game plans
00:20:45.840 reviewed by the creators. So half of the
00:20:47.760 ones that you send to, which leads to
00:20:49.440 about one to two partnerships closed
00:20:51.120 around 20 to 25 of the creators who you
00:20:53.039 send the game plan to. This is
00:20:54.799 consistent. It's not skills, it is math.
00:20:57.200 Okay? So your job isn't to hope it
00:20:59.120 works. Your job isn't to be extremely
00:21:00.880 skilled. Your job isn't to get lucky.
00:21:02.880 Okay? Your job is to send 100 messages
00:21:04.640 and let the math do its thing. So the
00:21:06.559 big question here is, are you willing to
00:21:08.240 send 100 messages to get your first
00:21:09.679 shadow operating partnership or screw
00:21:11.600 it? Let's say you do everything wrong
00:21:13.919 and it takes you five times more
00:21:15.360 messages on average to close your first
00:21:17.120 creator. So 500 messages, even in that
00:21:19.360 case, are you willing to send 500
00:21:20.880 messages to get one partnership that has
00:21:22.559 the potential to completely change your
00:21:24.000 financial situation. Most people won't,
00:21:25.679 and that's why most people fail. But if
00:21:27.200 you do, your likelihood of success is
00:21:29.120 extremely high. Your odds of making this
00:21:30.799 a full-time income are extremely real.
00:21:32.880 Now, here's why this is so important,
00:21:34.480 and this is where most people [ __ ] it
00:21:35.760 up. When you are a message 53 with no
00:21:38.400 partnership yet, you're feeling
00:21:39.760 discouraged. And you can look at your
00:21:41.120 track and see, I've sent 53 messages.
00:21:43.360 I've got five responses. I sent one game
00:21:45.200 plan. You know you're on track. You are
00:21:46.960 not failing. You are just at message 53.
00:21:49.600 All you have to do is just keep going
00:21:51.200 and let the math work. Okay? I want you
00:21:53.520 to think about it this way. If you flip
00:21:55.200 a coin, you have a 50% chance of heads.
00:21:57.679 you if you flip it a 100 times, the odds
00:21:59.760 that you hit um that you never hit heads
00:22:02.000 are basically zero. Okay? Just like
00:22:03.919 here, as long as you follow the outreach
00:22:05.760 principles I'm laying out, the chances
00:22:07.200 of reaching out to 100 creators and not
00:22:08.960 getting a response is virtually zero.
00:22:11.200 So, knowing that your skill level
00:22:13.120 doesn't define your success here, are
00:22:14.960 you willing to do what it takes to hit
00:22:16.240 the numbers to close your first shadow
00:22:17.760 operating partnership? If so, let's talk
00:22:19.840 about how to actually find and reach out
00:22:21.280 to creators. But before I show you the
00:22:23.120 exact message template, I need to teach
00:22:24.799 you the most important principle of
00:22:26.159 outreach. Okay, this is another
00:22:28.480 principle uh that completely changed the
00:22:30.320 way that I viewed outreach. This is
00:22:32.960 partnership principle number three. Lead
00:22:35.280 with value, not the ask. Let me tell you
00:22:36.960 a quick story. A few weeks ago, my head
00:22:38.720 of student success, Andre, was working
00:22:40.400 with a client of ours at Monetize who
00:22:42.159 was doing outreach for his shadow
00:22:43.520 operating business. Smart guy, already
00:22:45.440 have partnerships, years of corporate
00:22:46.880 experience, all the elements that you
00:22:48.480 expect from someone who's going to be ex
00:22:50.080 insanely successful with outreach. Then
00:22:52.080 he started reaching out to microcreators
00:22:53.760 and got nothing. So Andre asked him,
00:22:56.000 &quot;Show me what you're sending.&quot; He pulls
00:22:57.600 up his message. &quot;Hi, I'm a business
00:22:59.120 consultant. Would you like to discuss
00:23:00.400 how I can help grow your company right
00:23:02.000 away?&quot; Of course, Andre pointed out,
00:23:03.280 &quot;Look, that is your problem. You're
00:23:04.880 asking for something instead of giving
00:23:06.320 something.&quot; And here's what was
00:23:07.440 happening. When you reach out cold and
00:23:09.120 immediately ask them to discuss or hop
00:23:10.640 on a call, you're asking them to give
00:23:12.159 you your time. Okay? Time is the most
00:23:13.840 valuable thing that anyone has. We are
00:23:15.440 all busy. So imagine if someone you
00:23:17.120 don't know simply open a conversation
00:23:18.799 with you asking for your time. Okay?
00:23:20.559 What would you think? Who is this? Why
00:23:22.320 should I give them my time? It is
00:23:24.000 instant rejection. It sounds obvious
00:23:25.440 when I put it like this. But this is the
00:23:26.799 mistake that most people make in shadow
00:23:28.159 operating. They are reaching out saying,
00:23:30.000 &quot;Hey, want a partner? Can we discuss a
00:23:31.679 business opportunity? Would you be open
00:23:32.880 to a call?&quot; Do not do that. Okay? Every
00:23:34.720 single one is asking the creator or
00:23:36.480 sorry, every single one of those is
00:23:38.080 asking the creator to give. So, you're
00:23:40.000 going to get ignored every time. Just
00:23:41.440 like you ignore people who reach out to
00:23:42.880 you in the same way. Here is what
00:23:44.320 changed everything for this client.
00:23:45.440 Instead of asking for a call, Andre told
00:23:47.200 him to give them something valuable
00:23:48.640 instead, something that they could use.
00:23:50.559 So he started creating monetization game
00:23:53.200 plans exactly as you learned how to do
00:23:55.200 yesterday. Then he would open the
00:23:56.960 conversation with permission, a
00:23:58.559 permissionbased message such as, &quot;Have
00:24:00.480 you ever thought about packaging what
00:24:01.840 you teach into something that people
00:24:03.039 would pay for?&quot; And after he got the
00:24:04.960 response, he would say, &quot;Well, I've put
00:24:06.880 together three ways you could package
00:24:08.240 your content into a digital product that
00:24:09.840 your followers would pay for. Would you
00:24:11.440 like me to send you a full breakdown?&quot;
00:24:12.960 Response rate went from zero to three to
00:24:15.360 four yeses a day. Why? Because he was
00:24:17.679 giving first, not asking. When they saw
00:24:19.760 the monetization game plan, they were so
00:24:22.000 impressed that closing a partnership
00:24:24.000 became easy after that. That is exactly
00:24:26.240 how shadow operating works. You are
00:24:28.000 giving them something valuable,
00:24:29.360 something that they can either use when
00:24:30.960 they work with you or not. Okay? And
00:24:33.120 when they see that you've analyzed their
00:24:35.919 content, you've identified the problems
00:24:37.520 they're consistently think about
00:24:38.640 monetization, and you've proposed a
00:24:40.400 solution that solves their problem with
00:24:42.159 inconsistent income and even projected
00:24:44.559 potential profit numbers, they're
00:24:46.240 already 80% convinced. But if you lead
00:24:49.279 asking for their time like, &quot;Hey, would
00:24:50.480 you like to hop on a call?&quot; You're dead
00:24:52.000 in the water. Okay, that is partnership
00:24:53.760 principle number three. Always lead with
00:24:55.440 value. So, are we in agreement here that
00:24:57.600 when you start reaching out to creators,
00:24:59.039 you're always going to lead with value.
00:25:01.120 If you understand that and you commit to
00:25:02.799 always reaching out first with value, I
00:25:05.039 want you to go ahead and drop the
00:25:06.159 hashtag shadow operator or with a
00:25:08.559 hashtag or no hashtag, go ahead and drop
00:25:10.720 shadow operator in the comments so that
00:25:12.799 way I can see that you guys are
00:25:14.159 following along. And with that being
00:25:15.440 said, I'll have a little swig of water.
00:25:23.840 All right. All right. Lovely. Look, a
00:25:27.279 lot of people get intimidated and think
00:25:28.720 that these creators are above them in
00:25:30.159 some way, shape, form, or fashion just
00:25:31.520 because they have a tiny little
00:25:32.559 following. So, let me put something into
00:25:34.000 perspective for you guys, okay? There
00:25:35.679 are 78 million content creators out
00:25:37.440 there just on Instagram alone. Okay?
00:25:40.320 Micro creators, the ones we're targeting
00:25:42.000 here, there are 41 million of them. All
00:25:44.000 of them need monetization and you you
00:25:46.559 just need one yes. Okay, that's it. Just
00:25:48.720 one yes. So, let's be honest here. Even
00:25:51.440 if you do everything wrong, do you think
00:25:53.760 that it's unlikely that one in 41
00:25:56.159 million creators would say yes to your
00:25:57.760 shadow operating proposal? I don't think
00:25:59.520 so. Right? You need one person in a
00:26:01.440 crowd the size of half of Germany to say
00:26:03.760 yes. Imagine the ocean has 41 million
00:26:06.320 fish. You don't need to catch them all,
00:26:07.760 my friend. You don't even need to be
00:26:09.120 good at fishing. You just need to catch
00:26:11.360 one fish once. Now, how many shadow
00:26:14.400 operators do you know that you that you
00:26:16.159 can partner with? Okay, probably not
00:26:17.760 that many.
00:26:19.919 There might be what, a few thousand out
00:26:21.840 there, if even that. Okay, even if we
00:26:23.760 take everyone who's watching this live
00:26:25.120 right now, okay, the tens of thousands
00:26:27.360 of people who are watching right now and
00:26:28.720 all of you become shadow operators in
00:26:30.720 total. Okay, that would be 50,000 shadow
00:26:32.799 operators. Okay, let me check how many
00:26:34.559 we got live right now. Uh,
00:26:37.520 pull up the accurate number. All right,
00:26:39.279 so from the 17,000 we got on here. Okay,
00:26:42.400 that would be 17,000 shadow operators.
00:26:44.240 Okay, the the the supply to demand curve
00:26:46.559 is insane. Okay, there is simply far
00:26:50.080 more demand than there is supply. Okay,
00:26:54.480 there are tens of millions of creators
00:26:56.720 who need monetization, but only a few
00:26:58.799 thousand shadow operators to fulfill
00:27:00.320 that demand. So, when you look at this,
00:27:02.480 who do you think holds the power in this
00:27:04.000 relationship? The creators or the shadow
00:27:05.440 operator? Who needs who more? Okay, can
00:27:07.440 we agree that the creators need the
00:27:08.720 shadow operators way more than the
00:27:10.080 shadow operators need the creators?
00:27:11.840 Because as a shadow operator, you get to
00:27:14.000 choose which creators you want to work
00:27:15.279 with. You can just open Instagram and
00:27:17.440 find hundreds of creators in a matter of
00:27:19.200 minutes. Now, the creator, they don't
00:27:20.720 have an app like Instagram that they can
00:27:22.240 just open and find hundreds of shadow
00:27:23.760 operators to work with them. That is why
00:27:25.440 I receive messages like this every
00:27:27.120 single day from creators with 10,000,
00:27:28.799 20,000, 50,000, 100,000 followers and
00:27:30.799 more. Because as a shadow operator, you
00:27:32.640 possess an extremely rare and valuable
00:27:34.559 power to turn something that these
00:27:36.080 creators already have a following into
00:27:38.240 money. So if there's something if
00:27:39.840 there's someone who's above you or sorry
00:27:41.840 who's above in this relationship, that
00:27:44.000 person is actually you. At the end of
00:27:45.520 the day, it's all about perspective.
00:27:46.799 Most people do the best that they know.
00:27:48.400 So they think about it, okay? They think
00:27:50.000 about and they go, what does the creator
00:27:51.600 know? They know how to create content or
00:27:53.600 how to gather an audience. They know
00:27:54.880 that posting content is a lot of work.
00:27:56.320 And they know that I can sell brand
00:27:57.760 sponsorships. They also know that
00:27:59.440 sponsors only show up uh once in a
00:28:01.600 while, okay? And that's not a reliable
00:28:03.600 source of income. So, they're thinking,
00:28:05.760 I need to find another way to make more
00:28:07.360 money with this and I need to do it
00:28:08.640 quickly. Otherwise, I don't know how
00:28:10.320 long I'll be able to keep posting
00:28:11.520 because this is not sustainable. They're
00:28:13.279 doing the best they can when it comes to
00:28:14.880 monetization. They just don't know any
00:28:16.559 better. Now, you you do because here is
00:28:19.039 what you know. You know, micro creators
00:28:20.799 with audiences are an untapped gold
00:28:22.880 mine. You know there's uh you you know
00:28:24.880 that there's a replicable and a very
00:28:26.640 straightforward way to turn followers
00:28:28.159 into money in their bank account. You
00:28:30.559 know the best way to monetize an
00:28:31.840 audience is not through brand
00:28:33.039 sponsorships but rather through digital
00:28:34.960 products. You know these digital
00:28:36.399 products can be created super quickly
00:28:38.080 all in one or two days when you use
00:28:39.679 specialized AI. And you know that in 14
00:28:41.919 days you can launch this digital product
00:28:43.520 to the creator's audience and get them
00:28:45.120 hyped to buy it just using Instagram
00:28:46.960 stories. And more importantly you know
00:28:48.480 how to use specialized AI to do all the
00:28:50.480 work for you. So that way when you
00:28:52.159 realize that you know all uh sorry so
00:28:54.640 that way when you realize that you know
00:28:56.399 all these things and that you know that
00:28:58.000 they can all that it can all be done
00:28:59.600 with specialized AI while the creators
00:29:01.679 knows none of this and they don't have
00:29:03.200 access to the tools. Doesn't it make
00:29:05.279 sense that you have the exact solution
00:29:06.799 to the problems that they have? It's as
00:29:08.799 if they have the lock and you have the
00:29:11.200 keys. When you have the keys you don't
00:29:13.039 need to understand how a lock mechanism
00:29:15.440 works or how to pick a lock manually.
00:29:17.279 You just use the key and the lock opens.
00:29:19.600 And that is what I want you to
00:29:20.799 understand here. So if you want to close
00:29:22.640 your first partnership in the first
00:29:24.000 month with this model, here is exactly
00:29:25.760 where the next 30 days should look like.
00:29:27.200 From finding the creator to closing the
00:29:29.120 partnership, days one to two, here's
00:29:30.960 what you're going to do. You're going to
00:29:32.159 use the perfect storm framework to find
00:29:33.919 your unique niche, the combination of
00:29:35.679 industries, you know the market needs,
00:29:37.360 the right AI to get all the work done
00:29:39.360 for you without having to actually
00:29:40.480 develop the skills. Day three to four,
00:29:42.399 you're going to find a 100 micro
00:29:43.840 creators and you know exactly how to do
00:29:45.360 that. You're going to go to Instagram,
00:29:46.480 you search for your niche plus a content
00:29:47.919 related keyword. such as tips or how-to.
00:29:50.320 Then from the results, you're going to
00:29:51.440 find creators with 10 to 100,000
00:29:53.360 followers who don't have their own
00:29:54.640 digital product yet and are simply
00:29:56.320 living off of brand sponsorships. You're
00:29:58.080 then going to list a hundred of them,
00:29:59.760 okay, inside of your CRM. For that, you
00:30:01.840 will inevitably have to pay for a CRM.
00:30:03.919 Otherwise, you won't uh you won't
00:30:05.120 actually have a way to track your
00:30:06.159 outreaches that we talked about. Then on
00:30:09.120 days 5 to 7, you're going to start
00:30:10.880 sending your initial outreach messages,
00:30:12.399 and you're going to do it using the
00:30:13.679 permissionbased outreach messages.
00:30:15.279 Inside of MAI, our clients use 50
00:30:17.279 different variations of this. It should
00:30:19.039 take you around 5 minutes per message.
00:30:20.720 So to send 100 messages, that will take
00:30:22.240 you about eight hours. So in total, if
00:30:24.080 you're doing this the most manual way
00:30:25.520 possible, this entire process will take
00:30:27.279 you anywhere from 14 to 16 hours in the
00:30:29.520 first week. Is it timeconuming? Yes.
00:30:31.440 Okay. Now, if you know this has the
00:30:34.320 potential to completely ch change your
00:30:35.919 financial life with one single yes out
00:30:37.760 of those 100 messages, do you think that
00:30:39.520 you can find 16 hours in your in your
00:30:41.520 week in order to do this? Even if it's
00:30:43.520 after work or during the weekends, I'm
00:30:45.440 sure you can. Now, here's what your week
00:30:47.360 two is going to look like. At this
00:30:48.480 point, you're going to start getting
00:30:49.760 replies to your initial outreach
00:30:51.440 messages. That will basically be
00:30:52.720 creators interested in the game plan you
00:30:54.320 mentioned. Now, because we're smart
00:30:56.000 here, we haven't developed the game plan
00:30:57.600 yet because we know uh because what
00:31:00.240 we're going to do instead is we're only
00:31:01.840 going to develop the game plan for the
00:31:03.679 creators who actually request it and are
00:31:06.159 actually interested. Okay? This way, we
00:31:08.320 don't waste a bunch of our time
00:31:09.440 developing dozens of game plans that no
00:31:11.520 one will look at. That is working
00:31:13.200 smarter, not harder. So, that way from
00:31:16.320 day seven uh to 14, we're going to be
00:31:18.159 doing two things simultaneously as the
00:31:20.320 replies start coming in. Whenever you
00:31:21.840 get a reply, you're going to develop the
00:31:23.200 game plan for the creator. How do you do
00:31:24.799 that? Exactly as I showed you in episode
00:31:26.720 one. If you want to do it manually,
00:31:28.480 you're going to have to manually come up
00:31:29.679 with the audit, the opportunity, the
00:31:30.960 numbers, the product suggestions, the
00:31:32.159 launch strategy, the TE's, and the
00:31:33.520 testing sequence, which again would take
00:31:35.279 a bunch of time for you to develop the
00:31:36.799 skills in order to do that. So, if you
00:31:38.880 want to do this manually on top of the
00:31:40.480 learning curve, it could take three to
00:31:42.080 four hours per creator because you have
00:31:44.000 to watch the content, take notes,
00:31:45.919 identify patterns, write the copy, do
00:31:47.519 the math, and format things nicely.
00:31:49.279 That's a lot of work. Okay, so here's
00:31:51.279 where the specialized AI does all of the
00:31:53.039 heavy lifting for you. It is as simple
00:31:55.120 as pasting the links to the Instagram of
00:31:57.120 the creator into the specialized AI tool
00:31:59.519 and filling out some very basic
00:32:01.039 information like the number of followers
00:32:02.720 and engagement rate and voila, that's
00:32:04.559 it. Just click a few buttons. Okay, then
00:32:06.799 all you have to do is click generate and
00:32:08.720 you will get the entire game plan
00:32:10.159 developed for you. Here are a few
00:32:12.000 examples of what these game plans look
00:32:13.679 like from clients of ours at monetize
00:32:15.679 who took advantage of the specialized AI
00:32:17.440 tools that come with the done for you
00:32:19.519 approach. So that's week two. Week
00:32:21.760 three, very simple. If you remember back
00:32:23.600 from yesterday's episode, a key part of
00:32:25.200 the game plan is that we send a demand
00:32:26.880 testing story for the creator to post.
00:32:28.799 It's basically a sequence of three
00:32:30.080 stories they can post saying that they
00:32:31.919 are considering launching this digital
00:32:33.519 product and asking their audience to
00:32:35.200 reply if they would be interested in it.
00:32:36.960 And usually what happens, they get
00:32:38.640 dozens, if not hundreds of replies.
00:32:40.640 their audience says, &quot;Yes, please. I
00:32:42.320 would be super interested in that. Do
00:32:43.679 you have a release date yet? Take my
00:32:45.200 money. That's exactly what I've been
00:32:46.640 looking for.&quot; And every single reply
00:32:48.480 feels like a cash machine ringing with a
00:32:50.240 sale for them. So that way when they
00:32:51.840 experience that, they have no option but
00:32:53.519 to reply to you because they now see
00:32:55.120 with their own eyes that you have the
00:32:56.960 solution. They've been desperately
00:32:58.000 looking for a way to monetize their
00:32:59.760 audience consistently without depending
00:33:01.600 on sponsors. So that way when you start
00:33:03.360 getting your first few positive
00:33:04.640 responses to your game plan, all you
00:33:06.320 need to do now is explain the
00:33:07.519 partnership terms to the creator. Now,
00:33:09.200 there are four main points that we're
00:33:10.320 going to hit here. What you handle on
00:33:11.679 your side. So, that is developing the
00:33:13.039 14-day story sequence, sending all the
00:33:14.960 text for each one of the stories for the
00:33:16.240 creator to post, helping with the right
00:33:18.000 product packaging, and developing uh
00:33:20.159 developing the overall outline for the
00:33:21.679 creator. Again, you're going to get all
00:33:23.840 this done for you with specialized AI.
00:33:25.840 And then you're going to set the product
00:33:26.880 up on WP, which takes about 5 minutes to
00:33:28.480 do or so. This way, the product gets
00:33:30.080 delivered automatically whenever anyone
00:33:31.760 buys it. All of which, as I said, AI,
00:33:33.840 specialized AI takes care of this. Then,
00:33:35.760 you're going to discuss what the creator
00:33:37.120 will handle on their side. That's very
00:33:38.559 simple. Posting the Instagram stories
00:33:40.240 with the exact text you send them. And
00:33:41.840 that's all about the responsibilities
00:33:43.039 they have on their side. It's really not
00:33:44.399 that many, right? And that's why it's so
00:33:46.000 easy for them to say yes to this because
00:33:47.600 they barely have to do anything to make
00:33:49.519 money here. Number three is to agree on
00:33:51.600 the timelines. And the timelines here
00:33:53.360 are super simple. The first thing you do
00:33:55.440 is develop the outline, which will take
00:33:56.880 you a few minutes. Then you need to
00:33:58.480 generate the 14 days of Instagram story
00:34:00.320 sequences, which again takes 14 clicks.
00:34:02.480 You just go through this process you're
00:34:04.080 seeing here on screen for each one of
00:34:05.519 the days. you can get it done in a few
00:34:07.039 hours. But let's even say you're doing
00:34:08.879 everything super slow, taking your time,
00:34:10.560 and it takes you a full day to develop
00:34:12.159 the proc outline and another full day to
00:34:14.239 develop the story sequences. That's 2
00:34:16.159 days of work. After that, that is all
00:34:18.560 that is needed in order to post one
00:34:20.399 story sequence for the next 14 days. So
00:34:22.879 really, from the moment you sign a
00:34:24.320 partnership, it takes you two two days
00:34:26.399 to get everything right and start
00:34:28.000 posting the story sequences. And the
00:34:29.679 story sequences take 14 days. So really,
00:34:32.000 the timeline here is 16 days. But if you
00:34:34.560 want to be conservative with your
00:34:35.839 promises for the creator, 16 days is a
00:34:38.159 bit over 2 weeks. So let's call it 4
00:34:40.159 weeks. Then from 16 to 28 days. That's
00:34:42.719 your timeline. The final thing you agree
00:34:44.560 upon is the revenue split between you
00:34:46.000 and the creator. And here there's no
00:34:47.679 right or wrong. Okay? My recommendation
00:34:49.280 be very conservative with it on your
00:34:51.040 first time doing it. I recommend a 70
00:34:52.800 to30 split. You keep 30% of the revenue.
00:34:55.040 The creator keeps 70%. You do most of
00:34:56.800 the work. The creator keeps most of the
00:34:58.079 money. Okay? It's hard not to say no to
00:34:59.839 that proposal. If you take the example
00:35:01.440 from Kim again, you can see had he had a
00:35:03.599 40% split with the creator. He let the
00:35:05.839 creator keep most of the money. And
00:35:07.280 that's what you should do as well. And
00:35:08.880 with that, you'll have all of your
00:35:10.960 partnership terms agreed agreed upon.
00:35:13.040 This is super simple. Most people
00:35:14.640 overcomplicated. They try to push for a
00:35:16.640 percentage that's a bit too high, which
00:35:18.560 then causes resistance and then they end
00:35:20.640 up losing potential partnership. There
00:35:22.480 is no reason to do that when you are
00:35:24.000 first starting out. So my advice is
00:35:25.520 this. Just don't add obstacles on your
00:35:27.359 way. Okay? Keep it simple. So that way,
00:35:29.520 can you see how offering the creator to
00:35:31.119 keep 70% of the entire earnings while
00:35:33.680 you do most of the work makes the
00:35:35.599 proposal virtually impossible to refuse,
00:35:38.079 especially when they are currently
00:35:39.520 making zero from their audience and you
00:35:41.359 are offering to create a new revenue
00:35:42.800 stream from scratch. So once you have
00:35:45.119 all of that in place, week four becomes
00:35:46.800 all about kicking off your first shadow
00:35:48.320 operating job and starting to collect
00:35:50.160 cash. And here you already know exactly
00:35:52.320 what to do. Develop the product outline
00:35:54.240 using specialized AI. Generate the
00:35:56.160 14-day story sequence. Also, once again,
00:35:58.240 with specialized AI, so that way you
00:35:59.760 don't have to write a single word
00:36:00.800 yourself. Send the sequences for the
00:36:02.560 creator to post. If you had the right AI
00:36:04.720 tools to take care of all of that, don't
00:36:06.400 you think you could handle it? When you
00:36:07.920 execute this process correctly, you
00:36:09.440 should be able to close your first
00:36:10.400 shadow operating partnership in the next
00:36:12.079 30 to 60 days. And then, if you want to
00:36:14.000 keep repeating this process, you can
00:36:15.359 realistically get one to two new shadow
00:36:17.280 operating partnerships per month. If
00:36:19.200 each partnership generates 20,000, well
00:36:21.280 then that's 20 to 40,000 in new revenue
00:36:23.359 each month. That is six figures a year
00:36:25.119 on the low end and you can scale to
00:36:26.800 millions on the higher end. And you can
00:36:28.480 choose whether you want one shadow
00:36:29.839 operating partnership or if you want to
00:36:31.920 grow from there. Okay? To make this much
00:36:33.839 in a regular job takes a lot of
00:36:35.280 qualifications, decades of work, and
00:36:36.880 slave like hours. Now, when you're a
00:36:38.640 shadow operator, six figures a year is
00:36:40.160 the norm. The reality is there's
00:36:41.920 unpreced unprecedented precedented
00:36:44.560 demand for shadow operating in 2026.
00:36:46.800 Apologize. I'm getting so excited about
00:36:48.079 this stuff and there are simply not
00:36:49.520 enough people to fulfill such a demand.
00:36:51.920 So, if you ever want to be early for
00:36:53.680 something big, trust me, this is it. And
00:36:56.640 now is the perfect time to take
00:36:58.240 advantage of this at the very beginning
00:37:00.000 of 2026. Now, you've only still seen a
00:37:03.599 tiny fraction of the success that people
00:37:05.040 are having with shadow operating. There
00:37:06.720 are tens of thousands of creators making
00:37:08.800 significant income from digital products
00:37:10.880 on [ __ ] and millions of creators who
00:37:12.960 haven't yet monetized their audience
00:37:14.320 with this. And that is how you know this
00:37:16.079 stuff works. It will work for you. After
00:37:17.599 all, it worked for Kim to make $2,800 in
00:37:20.000 the first week of January. For Ted to
00:37:21.680 make $20,000 as a shadow operator from
00:37:23.680 his first client just 12 months ago
00:37:25.440 while he was still in college. For me to
00:37:27.200 make $20,000 in 3 days from a single
00:37:29.200 creator partnership back when I was
00:37:30.640 first starting out in 2018. For Jason
00:37:32.800 who built an entire career based off of
00:37:35.119 this model. For our clients to earn 15
00:37:37.200 million in the last 90 or in a 90-day
00:37:39.119 period inside of Monetized Mania for the
00:37:41.440 competition. for regular everyday people
00:37:43.359 to earn over 1 billion with digital
00:37:45.200 products on [ __ ] in just the last 6
00:37:47.200 months and I could keep going on for
00:37:49.040 ages. So can you see how you are only
00:37:51.760 one shadow operating partnership away
00:37:53.440 from the life that you have always
00:37:55.280 dreamed of?
00:38:00.800 Well, if you understand,
00:38:03.040 I'm very happy. And if you understand,
00:38:08.320 then I I think truly 2026 not only can
00:38:13.599 be but will be the greatest year of your
00:38:15.119 life. Okay? And I hope at this point you
00:38:17.119 understand how having the right
00:38:18.640 specialized AI tools is the key to
00:38:20.400 launching that one profitable
00:38:21.599 partnership. So are you getting excited
00:38:24.480 about the idea of finally making real
00:38:26.320 income from an online business? And
00:38:28.160 wouldn't you agree that having right now
00:38:29.839 is the best time to take advantage of
00:38:31.359 specialized to actually partner with
00:38:32.960 these creators? So that's why I created
00:38:35.440 a done for you approach where you get
00:38:37.200 all the steps of the process done for
00:38:38.960 you using specialized AI and you count
00:38:41.200 on the help of my own internal team.
00:38:43.440 Everything I just showed you, the niche
00:38:45.119 selection framework, the outreach
00:38:46.400 sequence, the dream 100 strategy, all of
00:38:48.480 it comes from consulting accelerator,
00:38:50.000 the legendary program that helped over
00:38:52.000 40,000 people start an online business
00:38:53.920 and generated almost 80 million in
00:38:55.839 sales. I went through Consulting
00:38:57.119 Accelerator myself years ago and
00:38:58.480 honestly it changed the way I think
00:38:59.680 about business. The frameworks in that
00:39:01.280 program, particularly around niche
00:39:02.560 selection, positioning, client
00:39:03.680 acquisition, they apply to any business
00:39:05.680 that you are partnering with. And that
00:39:07.599 is exactly what shadow operating is.
00:39:09.680 You're essentially consulting for
00:39:10.960 creators. So instead of having to do
00:39:13.520 consulting work based on knowledge and
00:39:14.880 experience, instead you're doing it by
00:39:16.720 taking advantage of specialized AI to do
00:39:18.720 the work for you. One of the principles
00:39:20.320 I learned in Consulting Accelerator was
00:39:21.920 don't reinvent the wheel. Find proven
00:39:23.680 systems and adapt them. And that's
00:39:25.359 exactly what I'm giving you. The proven
00:39:27.119 systems that I have adapted. I took the
00:39:29.920 proven consulting accelerator
00:39:31.119 frameworks, combined them with
00:39:32.400 specialized AI tools, applied them to
00:39:34.160 the industry with the biggest gap
00:39:35.440 between supply and demand and created a
00:39:37.599 donefor you system where you don't have
00:39:39.680 to find creators yourself, where you
00:39:41.280 have the specialized AI tool that does
00:39:42.880 all the heavy lifting for you, where you
00:39:44.560 get access to proven systems and
00:39:46.000 frameworks. So if you are interested in
00:39:47.920 having this done for you system, I have
00:39:49.680 something very special for you. And by
00:39:51.200 the way, it involves consulting
00:39:52.640 accelerator itself. So it is with great
00:39:54.640 pleasure that I introduce to you the
00:39:56.480 latest version of monetize starting with
00:39:58.960 a special bonus that you will only get
00:40:00.800 here today during this live session.
00:40:02.880 That is full access to consulting
00:40:05.280 accelerator. Okay. Now let me tell you a
00:40:08.160 story of how this was even became
00:40:09.680 possible. About a year ago I acquired
00:40:12.000 consulting accelerator including all of
00:40:13.839 its intellectual property or sorry a
00:40:15.200 consulting.com including all of its
00:40:16.640 intellectual property. I paid $1.7
00:40:18.880 million out of my own pocket to get
00:40:20.640 access to this. Now, I don't think
00:40:22.480 there's any program out there that's
00:40:23.839 made as many people quit their jobs and
00:40:25.920 reach six and seven figures as this
00:40:27.760 program. And it became legendary in the
00:40:29.599 online business space. This program
00:40:31.280 helped people like Andrew Argu scale to
00:40:33.200 $900,000 a month in the accounting
00:40:34.880 niche. Hunter scale to six figures a
00:40:36.720 month uh in the porn addiction with porn
00:40:38.720 addiction consulting. Britney grow to
00:40:40.800 $30,000 a month in the binge eating
00:40:42.640 niche. And literally thousands of other
00:40:44.240 people
00:40:45.920 start six and seven figure consulting
00:40:47.680 businesses. The program originally sold
00:40:49.440 for almost $2,000. Over 20,000 people
00:40:51.760 paid that price. I was one of them. And
00:40:53.760 just like it helped me when I was
00:40:55.200 starting out, I wanted to help you as
00:40:56.880 well. When I acquired the company,
00:40:58.640 including all of its intellectual
00:40:59.839 property, I knew that I couldn't just
00:41:01.440 let it disappear. This program changed
00:41:03.359 too many lives. So, I'm making it a part
00:41:05.599 of Monetize. Not as an upsell, not as an
00:41:07.520 add-on, but as a free gift, and as a
00:41:10.240 free bonus for everyone who joins today.
00:41:12.480 So, when you join monetize, here is what
00:41:14.720 you are going to get on top of
00:41:15.920 consulting accelerator. Let me show you
00:41:17.760 why this is a truly done for you
00:41:19.280 solution. The entire session today was
00:41:21.119 about finding the right creators. And
00:41:22.560 you can see that although this is a
00:41:23.839 straightforward process, it takes time.
00:41:25.839 It's overwhelming. Okay? It's very
00:41:27.520 timeconuming and this is where a lot of
00:41:29.200 people go wrong. They choose the wrong
00:41:30.800 creators to approach in the first place.
00:41:32.319 And then it doesn't matter if you do
00:41:34.000 everything right after get it. If you
00:41:35.839 get this first step wrong, the whole
00:41:37.680 process fails. So what if you didn't
00:41:39.359 have to do all this work yourself to
00:41:40.800 filter out the wrong creators? What if
00:41:42.160 instead you already had a unique
00:41:44.160 prevetted list of micro creators that
00:41:46.000 you already had access to? So that way
00:41:48.000 you could skip this whole trial and
00:41:49.440 error process. Well, that is what me and
00:41:51.920 my team set out ourselves to put
00:41:54.079 together for you. For the people who
00:41:55.359 join monetize, my team and I are doing
00:41:57.280 the first step for you. We are manually
00:41:59.280 sourcing 100 creators for you, compiling
00:42:01.440 them in a list, loading them straight up
00:42:03.200 into your C into your CRM. So that way
00:42:05.440 there's literally zero work for you.
00:42:06.960 Okay? And as we've seen here together,
00:42:08.800 100 is our magic number. If you reach
00:42:11.280 out to a hundred of the right creators
00:42:12.720 with the right approach, your likelihood
00:42:14.319 of closing your first shadow operating
00:42:15.760 partnership is incredibly high. So that
00:42:18.319 is what you're getting today. This first
00:42:19.920 step, it is done for you already. When
00:42:21.599 you realize what we're doing here with
00:42:23.040 this first step is manually vetting and
00:42:25.119 compiling a 100 prequalified creators
00:42:27.359 directly into your CRM. Doesn't that
00:42:29.359 eliminate the biggest barrier between
00:42:30.800 you and closing your first partnership?
00:42:32.960 Well, that leads us directly to the next
00:42:34.640 software that you get inside Multise.
00:42:36.480 Because you might be asking, where am I
00:42:38.000 going to get this list? or am I going to
00:42:39.440 get a text file with just a bunch of
00:42:40.880 names and email inside? No, of course
00:42:42.720 not. We have you covered in this
00:42:44.240 episode, okay? Making this work, not
00:42:46.960 about the skills. It's about simply
00:42:48.560 hitting the numbers. And to hit the
00:42:50.079 numbers, you have to have the right CRM
00:42:51.520 that allows you to do this. That allows
00:42:53.440 you basically to compile all of your
00:42:54.800 micro creators and track if you've
00:42:56.319 reached out to them already, okay? If
00:42:57.920 they've replied to you, how many game
00:42:59.440 plans you've developed, and so on.
00:43:01.119 Because what gets measured gets
00:43:02.480 improved. That's 80% of success here.
00:43:04.400 Now, building a system like this
00:43:05.839 yourself gets super messy super quickly,
00:43:07.920 especially if you're trying to do it on
00:43:09.280 a spreadsheet. It's just not where you
00:43:10.960 should be spending your time as a shadow
00:43:12.319 operator. Now, on the other hand, buying
00:43:14.160 a CRM can get very expensive. If you
00:43:16.240 look at the most popular ones out there,
00:43:17.599 like Salesforce, we're talking about
00:43:18.800 $1,000 a year just for the most basic
00:43:20.400 plan. And to be honest, it comes with a
00:43:22.079 steep learning curve. There's too many
00:43:23.599 features that you don't need and will
00:43:25.040 never use. It's just overwhelming for
00:43:26.960 something that should be simple and
00:43:28.480 intuitive. That's precisely why a few
00:43:30.480 years ago, I co-founded Closy uh Floy, I
00:43:33.280 should say. uh 5 years ago at this
00:43:35.040 point, an internal CRM for our
00:43:36.800 service-based business to run their
00:43:38.319 entire operations. And to date, we've
00:43:40.400 had over 50,000 businesses using our
00:43:42.400 CRM, and we've closed over 35 million in
00:43:44.880 revenue through it. Usually, users pay
00:43:47.119 over $1,000 a year to access Flowzy. But
00:43:49.520 today, inside of Monetize, you get a
00:43:51.280 one-year license to it at no extra cost.
00:43:53.520 And not only that, but your 100 CRM will
00:43:56.000 come uh sorry, your CRM will come
00:43:58.160 pre-filled with a 100 leads that I just
00:44:00.160 mentioned. Can you now understand how uh
00:44:03.839 having this entire operational
00:44:05.359 infrastructure already built out for you
00:44:07.440 can uh and and means that you can focus
00:44:09.440 100% of your time on outreach and
00:44:11.680 partnerships instead of wrestling with
00:44:13.440 spreadsheets or learning complicated
00:44:15.520 software if so let's talk about the
00:44:17.920 specialized AI tools starting with
00:44:19.599 ghostriter the specialized AI that gets
00:44:21.520 the uh gets you basically past the most
00:44:24.160 time consuming and difficult part of
00:44:25.680 this whole process and make sure that is
00:44:27.680 done for you okay in just a matter of
00:44:30.240 clip clicks. The two main assets we need
00:44:32.560 to create here as a shadow operator are
00:44:34.240 the monetization game plan and the
00:44:35.920 14-day story sequence. Now,
00:44:37.839 historically, being able to create
00:44:39.280 assets like this would require you to
00:44:40.720 develop skills such as copywriting and
00:44:42.560 marketing strategy, which takes hundreds
00:44:44.480 and hundreds of hours to learn. That is
00:44:46.480 what I had to go through. That is what
00:44:47.920 Jason had to go through. And that's why
00:44:49.599 this industry uh that's why this
00:44:51.200 industry shadow the shadow operating
00:44:52.720 business usually in the past was
00:44:54.800 extremely difficult for beginners to get
00:44:56.400 into. Look, before specialized AI, I was
00:44:58.960 actually very vocal against beginners
00:45:01.040 doing this, okay? Because I didn't want
00:45:03.440 you have to spend months and months or
00:45:05.040 years learning and failing before you
00:45:07.119 start making money. And it's because of
00:45:08.800 the insane advancements in AI. The tool
00:45:10.720 is like Ghostriter OS now allow you to
00:45:13.040 skip this entire learning curve because
00:45:14.800 they do the work for you. The
00:45:16.400 monetization game plan, the 14-day story
00:45:18.240 sequence, that is now just a matter of a
00:45:20.319 few clicks and the AI develops
00:45:22.319 everything for you. It does it
00:45:23.839 everything. Okay? You don't even need to
00:45:25.440 trust yourself. You just trust the
00:45:27.200 software with better quality than 99% of
00:45:30.240 the specialized copywriters out there.
00:45:32.160 How insane is that? Isn't it incredible
00:45:34.079 that what used to take months and months
00:45:35.680 to learn can now be done in minutes with
00:45:37.599 AI? You see, Ghost Rider OS is a
00:45:40.000 collection of specialized AI agents that
00:45:42.079 write everything for you. Just so you
00:45:43.839 understand, this is not a small tool,
00:45:45.839 okay? This is this is a full-blown
00:45:47.920 suite, okay? This is an established
00:45:49.359 company with over 12,000 paying
00:45:51.359 customers from over 24 countries. They
00:45:53.520 are actually one of the few startups
00:45:54.800 that got accepted into the startup
00:45:56.560 accelerator program from Google,
00:45:58.240 Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. Which is
00:46:00.079 why it is one of the very few
00:46:02.240 specialized AI tools that gives you
00:46:04.079 access to what is known as zero prompt
00:46:06.400 agents. You know, look, when you go to
00:46:08.400 these $20 a month generic AIS, you have
00:46:10.560 to fully prompt it out. Okay? The
00:46:12.400 problem with that is for you to get the
00:46:14.160 AI to produce a monetization game plan
00:46:16.000 or a 14-day story sequence at this level
00:46:18.960 uh you know at the level I should say
00:46:20.960 that has the potential to generate tens
00:46:22.640 of thousands of dollars for your shadow
00:46:24.400 operating partnership. The prompt itself
00:46:26.400 would need to be truly a masterpiece. It
00:46:28.880 would take you weeks, sometimes even
00:46:30.240 months of trial and error to dial it in.
00:46:32.240 You would need to be a seasoned expert
00:46:33.760 to pull it off. For you to get a good
00:46:35.359 output, you would need to train what we
00:46:36.800 call an agent with hundreds of gigabytes
00:46:39.040 of data. And then you're going to need
00:46:41.280 to give it a very lengthy and and
00:46:43.599 detailed prompt. So that way it
00:46:45.040 understands exactly what makes a good
00:46:46.800 script. Inside of Ghostriter, you don't
00:46:48.560 need to give it any prompt, okay?
00:46:49.920 Because someone has already spent an
00:46:51.359 ungodly amount of time developing and
00:46:53.200 fine-tuning the prompts behind each
00:46:54.720 agent. And not just anyone, okay? But
00:46:56.880 the top experts in the world who have
00:46:58.480 made millions from their own digital
00:47:00.160 products. Someone who's tested hundreds
00:47:02.000 of variations and refined this prompt
00:47:03.760 based on real results from real
00:47:05.119 customers buying real products.
00:47:11.760 And that's why I say this is truly a
00:47:14.400 done for you solution. Okay, with this
00:47:16.079 done for you approach, you don't need to
00:47:17.359 trust yourself. All you need to do is
00:47:19.040 trust the software. Now, the step where
00:47:21.520 a lot of people get confused in this
00:47:22.800 process is actually product development.
00:47:24.160 They ask, &quot;But how am I supposed to
00:47:25.359 create a proc for the creator if I don't
00:47:26.640 know anything about the topic?&quot; You're
00:47:28.000 not supposed to. Okay, that is why I
00:47:29.680 created Synthesize. It is the world's
00:47:31.760 most powerful digital product creation
00:47:33.359 engine. Synthesize AI works like a
00:47:35.440 blackbox machine where you click a few
00:47:37.359 buttons on one side, you get a ready to
00:47:39.119 launch digital product generated for you
00:47:40.880 on the other side. It's like a printer
00:47:42.800 that prints winning digital products
00:47:44.400 using spe specialized AI. What we do
00:47:46.800 here is very simple. We take what Ghost
00:47:48.640 Rider already created for us. We feed
00:47:50.319 all that info into Synthesize. We let it
00:47:52.960 repackage this content into a ready to
00:47:55.440 launch digital product based on the
00:47:56.880 content that they already created in a
00:47:58.640 format that's organized, easy to
00:48:00.240 consume, and actionable for their
00:48:01.760 audience. and you get 20 plus digital
00:48:04.079 product options to pick from. All of
00:48:06.000 that within 40 minutes. You see,
00:48:07.599 Synthesize AI is a software that I've
00:48:09.440 been developing myself for this exact
00:48:11.040 purpose, helping me develop my own
00:48:12.960 digital products for over a year now.
00:48:14.640 It's currently on its 4.0 version. And
00:48:16.960 back when we launched the beta test, our
00:48:18.720 1.0 version, I decided to put it to test
00:48:21.040 without anyone knowing. The result, I
00:48:23.119 created a product that generated me over
00:48:24.720 $370,000 from 90 minutes of work. More
00:48:27.520 than 13,000 people purchased it. That's
00:48:29.839 more than most people make in a year. Do
00:48:31.760 you think that you can find 90 minutes
00:48:33.119 in your week to create a product for a
00:48:34.720 creator with the potential to generate
00:48:36.400 you more money than most people make in
00:48:37.920 an entire year and that our users are
00:48:40.400 already taking advantage of to create
00:48:41.920 wildly wildly wildly profitable digital
00:48:44.559 products for creators from zero even
00:48:46.960 with zero previous experience? Look,
00:48:49.839 last time we opened monetize last year,
00:48:51.680 the users who joined went on to make $15
00:48:53.599 million in the first 90 days. And lots
00:48:56.160 of them created their products using
00:48:57.839 Synthesize AI. So, I'm sure you can
00:48:59.599 understand why Synthesize AI 4.0 is
00:49:02.000 listed at $2,999,
00:49:04.240 especially when you consider the huge
00:49:06.160 costs that come with running this sort
00:49:07.920 of high demand t uh this sort of a high
00:49:10.319 demand task with AI and you get it at no
00:49:13.119 extra cost when you enroll in monetize
00:49:15.040 today. When you realize that creators
00:49:16.720 have already created all the content and
00:49:18.559 knowledge needed and synthesize simply
00:49:20.559 organizes it into an easy to consume
00:49:23.119 actionable format that their audience
00:49:24.880 will pay for, doesn't that remove the
00:49:26.880 single biggest mental barrier? stopping
00:49:28.720 people from actually becoming shadow
00:49:30.240 operators. So, you now know this entire
00:49:32.880 four-step shadow operating system that
00:49:34.400 I've been talking about. Well, I've
00:49:35.680 actually recorded the entire
00:49:36.960 implementation training, every single
00:49:38.640 detail, every click, every strategy from
00:49:40.720 complete beginner, closing your first
00:49:42.160 shadow operating partnership to your
00:49:43.760 first sale to scaling to tens of
00:49:45.520 thousands per month. You will watch over
00:49:47.359 my shoulder as I build actual digital
00:49:49.200 products. You're going to see every
00:49:50.559 mistake, every shortcut I take, every
00:49:52.400 breakthrough, everything that separates
00:49:54.400 winners from everyone else. Think of it
00:49:56.400 as having me basically as your own
00:49:58.160 personal trainer, but instead of
00:49:59.760 building muscle, we are building your
00:50:01.440 financial freedom. Most business coaches
00:50:03.520 charge $5,000 just for a basic course
00:50:05.680 outline, but you are getting the
00:50:07.599 complete implementation system that's
00:50:09.119 generating millions in real results at
00:50:11.200 no extra cost. Can you imagine the
00:50:13.040 relief of never having to wonder what is
00:50:15.040 the next step? Because every single move
00:50:17.040 is mapped out for you. With this, the
00:50:18.720 question isn't whether you can figure
00:50:19.920 this out, it's whether you can follow
00:50:21.599 simple instructions. That is the type of
00:50:23.520 unfair advantage I'm referring to when I
00:50:25.680 talk about giving you a proven system.
00:50:27.520 Now, I know a lot of you guys would love
00:50:30.160 to have some sort of credent credentials
00:50:32.160 to show these creators. This way, you
00:50:33.760 can have third party proof that you're
00:50:35.520 qualified to do the job and something
00:50:37.200 like that can increase your authority by
00:50:38.800 10x in the eyes of these people. So, I
00:50:40.800 thought to myself, what what could I
00:50:42.720 actually give you to increase your
00:50:43.920 authority to the highest level possible
00:50:45.520 here? So, I had this idea. You see, as
00:50:48.000 you already know, I own Consulting.com,
00:50:50.000 which is the most successful consulting
00:50:51.440 firm in the digital product and shadow
00:50:53.040 operating space. So, I've decided to
00:50:55.280 create a consulting certificate that
00:50:56.960 recognizes you as a consulting.com
00:50:59.200 qualified shadow operator. This way, you
00:51:01.839 can tell creators when you're reaching
00:51:03.119 out to them that you're officially
00:51:04.400 qualified on this method and that
00:51:06.720 everything you'll implement is based on
00:51:08.240 the methodology taught by the number one
00:51:10.240 consulting firm in the world when it
00:51:11.920 comes to digital products. Do you
00:51:13.440 understand how this instantly positions
00:51:15.040 you as a qualified professional rather
00:51:17.040 than just another person with an idea?
00:51:18.720 And how with the cert certification, the
00:51:20.720 question of why should I trust you to do
00:51:22.240 this will never be a problem for you
00:51:23.839 ever again? Like can you like actually
00:51:26.400 understand and imagine how much easier
00:51:28.480 it's going to be your conversation when
00:51:30.800 you can lead with I am a consultant.com
00:51:32.720 certified AI shadow operator instead of
00:51:35.280 trying to convince them from scratch
00:51:36.640 that you know what you're doing. So,
00:51:38.160 look, that's another perk that you get
00:51:39.680 for free inside Multi as soon as you
00:51:41.599 complete our entire program. Now, to
00:51:44.240 light a fire under your ass and give you
00:51:45.760 an even bigger reason to take action on
00:51:47.359 becoming a shadow operator, I'm giving
00:51:48.720 you a golden ticket to our third edition
00:51:50.559 of our Monetized Mania competition. Here
00:51:52.720 is how it works. Starting tomorrow,
00:51:54.720 we're off we're kicking off a 90-day

00:52:07.040 mastermind experience that clients
00:52:08.480 usually pay $25,000 to join. Okay, we
00:52:10.960 throw some insane experiences. We spend
00:52:12.800 hundreds of thousands of dollars on
00:52:14.319 these immersion experiences and these
00:52:16.000 masterminds. And as I said, people in
00:52:17.760 the room are making 100,000, $200,
00:52:19.680 $500,000 a month from their shadow
00:52:21.680 operating business. And you will get to
00:52:23.200 personally network. You're going to
00:52:24.319 personally meet all these people as well
00:52:26.160 as myself and the rest of the team. How
00:52:27.760 insane of an opportunity would that be
00:52:29.839 for you to be able to sit in the same
00:52:31.599 room as the top shadow operators in the
00:52:33.680 world today? That is an opportunity you

00:53:52.720 until you 10x your investment guarantee.
00:53:54.559 More about this in just a minute. Last
00:53:56.079 time I opened this, monetized users
00:53:57.599 generated $15 million. And the users who
00:53:59.760 bought a proc live average 6,000 60,000
00:54:02.400 in earnings. And the total price for
00:54:04.160 this offer just from the things if you
00:54:05.760 had to buy them separately would cost
00:54:07.359 you $8,561.
00:54:09.680 Not to mention all the other stuff you

00:55:23.520 most sense to you and let's start
00:55:25.280 building and working on closing your
00:55:27.040 first partnership today because in a few
00:55:28.640 weeks from now, you could be launching
00:55:30.079 your first creator and getting sales
00:55:31.599 while everyone else is still trying to
00:55:33.440 figure it out on their own. Now, on top
00:55:35.599 of all of that, I want to offer you an
00:55:37.599 insane guarantee to back this up. This
00:55:39.839 is a better than money guarantee, okay?
00:55:41.839 It is a work with you until you win
00:55:43.520 guarantee. Here's how it works. You
00:55:45.520 don't just get access to all the tools
00:55:47.119 and the systems. You get me and my team
00:55:49.119 committed to working with you. Until you
00:55:50.960 close your first creator partnership and
00:55:52.720 make at least a 10x return on your
00:55:54.240 investment. Not until you feel ready.
00:55:55.599 Not until you understand everything.
00:55:56.960 Until you actually land a creator and
00:55:58.640 have a partnership that pays you and
00:56:00.240 pays you well. If it takes three months,
00:56:01.520 we're there. If it takes 6 months, we're
00:56:02.720 there. If it takes a year, we are still
00:56:04.319 there. Throughout this entire time, we
00:56:06.240 keep giving you updates, new training,
00:56:07.839 new support, new strategies, more done
00:56:09.520 for you. Exactly like we've already done
00:56:11.839 for our current users three times in the
00:56:13.760 last year. Look, I just gave you my
00:56:15.359 word. Now, let me show you my actions
00:56:16.960 because what I have done for our
00:56:18.079 monetized users, no one else in this
00:56:19.920 industry can say they did. Recently, we
00:56:22.160 discovered a new method to get digital
00:56:23.839 products insanely fast. Okay? We could
00:56:26.000 have offered that as a $2,000 upsell for
00:56:28.240 our current customers. And I know
00:56:29.520 thousands of people would have taken it.
00:56:30.960 But what did I do? I told you I'm not
00:56:33.200 going to keep charging you for updates
00:56:34.319 until you succeed. Okay? This is what we
00:56:35.920 did. We hosted an entire four-week
00:56:37.920 workshop within the Monetiz community,
00:56:39.680 breaking down this method through a [ __ ]
00:56:41.520 ton of live sessions completely for
00:56:43.359 free. By the way, you even have the
00:56:44.720 recordings when you join the community.
00:56:46.240 Every single user who joined Monetize in
00:56:48.160 January got the alpha version of
00:56:49.760 Synthesize for 995. Since then, the
00:56:52.000 software has got overgone two complete
00:56:53.760 overhauls. We've added dozens of new
00:56:55.599 features that weren't even promised. The
00:56:57.280 2.0 version, the 3.0 version, which
00:56:59.119 already made an entirely new software,
00:57:01.359 and now the 4.0 version with all the
00:57:03.920 shadow operating modules. And every
00:57:05.599 single one of our original customers got
00:57:07.440 the 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 version for free.
00:57:11.040 And the clients that we have are in awe
00:57:13.440 that they got access to all this for
00:57:14.960 free because this is the exact same
00:57:16.480 version that's listed for $2,999.
00:57:19.680 They got all of this at no extra charge.
00:57:22.960 Ghostriter, I have to pay almost
00:57:24.799 $100,000 per month to license it. Okay,
00:57:27.520 I pay per user per seat. The original
00:57:29.760 users of Monetize were not promises.
00:57:31.839 Okay, I still gave access to all them
00:57:34.079 for free and there were thousands of
00:57:35.520 seats that I had to pay for. Then I
00:57:37.280 created the shadow operator playbook
00:57:38.640 that was included in the original
00:57:39.920 package that we launched. Okay, or
00:57:41.520 sorry, I I should say it wasn't included
00:57:43.280 in the original package that we
00:57:44.559 launched. Okay, this was never included.
00:57:46.319 I could have easily sold it for $1,500
00:57:48.559 like I've done tens of thousands of
00:57:50.000 times with my previous programs. So what
00:57:51.520 did I do instead? I gave it to all my
00:57:53.280 monetized users for free. Then I
00:57:56.079 acquired a company called
00:57:57.040 Consulting.com.
00:57:58.640 This is the previous offices in
00:58:00.000 Manhattan. At the time I acquired it,
00:58:01.839 the flagship program sold for almost
00:58:03.920 $2,000. Over 20,000 customers had paid
00:58:06.559 that amount for the program. Okay. 690
00:58:08.880 million earned by students. 52
00:58:10.720 millionaires created out of it. I paid
00:58:12.319 $1.7 million out of pocket to acquire
00:58:14.400 this. Here's the receipt. Now, before I
00:58:16.240 acquired it, they made roughly 80
00:58:17.839 million in sales. As in, they pocketed
00:58:19.920 almost 80 million from the program.
00:58:22.160 Okay. Do you know how many times I've
00:58:23.760 sold this $2,000 program after the
00:58:25.440 acquisition? Zero. Instead, I gave it to
00:58:27.760 all my customers for free. Just a few
00:58:30.079 weeks ago, a few of my pro users had a
00:58:32.000 90-day consulting package that came to
00:58:33.599 an end. So what did I do? I renewed the
00:58:35.760 package for every single one of them
00:58:37.440 that still hadn't 10x their investment
00:58:39.119 for another 90 days just to make sure
00:58:41.040 that they were taken care of. And these
00:58:42.559 are just a few recent examples. So when
00:58:44.240 I say we work with you until you win, I
00:58:46.079 mean it. And as I always say, what you
00:58:48.960 need is the ability to create money on
00:58:50.720 demand. The skill of turning a creator's
00:58:52.720 audience into dollars, sorry, turning a
00:58:55.760 creator's audience into dollars in your
00:58:57.599 bank account. Because once you have that
00:58:58.960 skill, once you've closed that first 25
00:59:01.440 to 50k partnership, all your problems
00:59:03.520 disappear. You are not worried about
00:59:04.960 money anymore. You're not stuck in the 9
00:59:06.480 to5 grand anymore if you don't want to.
00:59:08.720 You get to make decisions from a place
00:59:10.240 of abundance, not necessity. And that is
00:59:12.400 worth infinitely more than $2,000. That
00:59:14.720 is why the guarantee isn't get your
00:59:16.240 money back if it doesn't work. The
00:59:17.520 guarantee is we work with you until it
00:59:19.520 does work. Period. It is simple. You
00:59:22.000 have to close your first creative
00:59:23.200 partnership and 10x your investment or
00:59:24.960 we will keep working with you until you
00:59:26.480 do. Because remember, with this
00:59:28.000 business, you only need to get this
00:59:29.520 right once. All it takes is one
00:59:31.200 partnership to completely change your
00:59:32.640 life situation to achieve what I call
00:59:34.720 your turning point. You see, from
00:59:36.400 everything I've accomplished so far,
00:59:37.680 what I'm proudest of is helping
00:59:39.280 thousands of people start their online
00:59:40.799 business and through that achieve their
00:59:42.640 turning point. That is the moment in
00:59:44.720 time where the income from their online
00:59:46.400 business surpasses their main income
00:59:47.920 stream and covers all their living
00:59:49.520 expenses. Usually, whenever someone buys
00:59:51.520 one of my digital products, they're one
00:59:53.040 of two situations. Either they're
00:59:54.559 working a job or studying where they
00:59:56.480 have little to no prospect of financial
00:59:58.160 growth. They know that's not what they
00:59:59.680 want to be doing, but they are stuck at
01:00:01.440 that job or uni with responsibilities
01:00:03.680 that stop them from quitting. Or they're
01:00:06.240 already working in very well-paid jobs,
01:00:08.079 sometimes self-employed or small
01:00:09.599 business owners, and they're already
01:00:10.960 making good money, but they simply can't
01:00:12.480 enjoy the fruits of their labor as they
01:00:14.240 wish because their work takes all of
01:00:16.000 their time and they're stuck in that
01:00:17.359 physical location. So, the point here is
01:00:19.280 this. In both circumstances, these
01:00:21.280 people feel like someone else is
01:00:22.559 controlling their lives. They feel
01:00:23.839 trapped in a life controlled by others
01:00:25.680 while watching their true potential slip
01:00:27.440 away. And this turning point I mentioned
01:00:29.359 is such a pivotal moment for them
01:00:30.880 because when they achieve that, that is
01:00:32.559 the moment they get to reclaim ownership
01:00:34.079 of their lives. It's the moment they get
01:00:35.440 to choose what they will do now. If
01:00:37.119 they're going to fire their boss, if
01:00:38.160 they're going to quit university, if
01:00:39.200 they're going to stop responding to
01:00:40.480 other people, they get to decide because
01:00:42.079 they are now the ones in control. And
01:00:43.920 there's nothing more liber liberating
01:00:45.599 than experiencing this transformation in
01:00:47.599 your own life. I experienced that myself
01:00:49.599 when I was able to quit school, look my
01:00:51.599 mom in the eyes, and tell her, &quot;Look, I
01:00:53.200 got you. Okay? You never need to worry
01:00:54.720 again.&quot; And look, I truly believe that
01:00:56.640 in 2026, the best and the fastest way to
01:00:58.559 achieve your turning point is by
01:01:00.640 becoming a shadow operator. The last
01:01:02.640 time I opened this opportunity, I helped
01:01:04.240 thousands of regular everyday people
01:01:06.000 achieve their turning point. And now I'm
01:01:08.079 ready to do that again and create a
01:01:09.599 legion of shadow operators. So, are you
01:01:12.160 willing to join me on this mission to
01:01:13.680 become a shadow operator and join me in
01:01:16.000 building this legion of successful
01:01:17.599 individuals who will achieve their
01:01:19.119 turning point? So, really, you have two
01:01:20.799 options. Either you succeed and close
01:01:22.480 your first creator partnership or we
01:01:24.240 keep working with you until you do. The
01:01:26.319 only way to lose is by not giving it a
01:01:28.160 try. In addition to that, your
01:01:29.520 investment is also fully protected with
01:01:31.359 a 7-day full uh refund policy. Meaning,
01:01:33.839 if for any reason you don't like what
01:01:35.200 you get inside Monetize, you have 7 days
01:01:36.880 to get 100% of your money back. All you
01:01:39.040 need to do is email support monetize and
01:01:40.880 ask for a refund and it will get
01:01:42.400 processed with no questions asked within
01:01:44.000 48 hours. With this, I'm taking all the
01:01:46.079 risk of our deal on me. Okay? I couldn't
01:01:48.240 be possibly taking on more risk on my
01:01:50.319 side. You don't have any risk on your
01:01:52.160 end today. By the way, if you have any

01:03:32.160 again. This might be the last time we
01:03:33.599 are doing this. So, if you want the
01:03:35.200 specialized AI tools, the complete
01:03:36.640 shadow operating system, full access to
01:03:38.480 consulting acceler accelerator, plus all
01:03:40.880 the additional bonuses, I want you to
01:03:42.720 click the link below right now. Join
01:03:44.640 monetize. Guys, I could keep going on
01:03:46.720 for a long, long time, but we are over
01:03:49.039 time already. And we have Jason here
01:03:50.960 waiting to get into the Q&amp;As's plus a
01:03:53.680 couple of very incredible guests who
01:03:55.520 might join us if time permits. So I want
01:03:58.720 to leave you one last message here.
01:04:00.400 Closing a single partnership is all you
01:04:02.319 need, okay, to be able to decide what
01:04:04.799 you work on, where you work from, when
01:04:06.799 you work, or even if you want to work in
01:04:08.400 the first place. No longer stress about
01:04:10.160 money, reclaim ownership of your life,
01:04:12.000 and be the one dictating the shots once
01:04:13.920 again. You're only one partnership away
01:04:15.599 from the life that you have always
01:04:16.880 dreamed of. And now with that being
01:04:18.559 said, it is time to get into our Q&amp;A.
01:04:21.280 And with that, I'm bringing in Jason
01:04:23.039 Fladlin. And let's get into
01:04:27.280 the more informal part of today's
01:04:28.960 session. Jason, thank you so much for
01:04:30.480 joining us.
01:04:31.039 >> Iman, it's always a pleasure, my friend,
01:04:33.200 and thank you to everybody for being
01:04:34.960 here this long because not everybody
01:04:36.960 makes it, unfortunately.
