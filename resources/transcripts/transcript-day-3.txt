00:00:00.400 I'm very excited to present to you day
00:00:02.399 three. Now, if you joined us yesterday
00:00:04.319 for day two, you already know something
00:00:05.839 that most people never figure out that
00:00:07.839 and that is I should say precisely how
00:00:10.480 to land a partnership as a shadow
00:00:12.080 operator. You literally have the entire
00:00:14.160 system to close creators. The audit, the
00:00:15.920 game plan, the outreach to actually get
00:00:17.600 them to say yes within 99% of the work
00:00:19.840 done for you by AI. But there's one
00:00:22.560 question left. Okay, Eman, I got
00:00:24.160 creators say yes. Now what? How do I
00:00:26.320 actually make money? That is what today
00:00:27.920 is about. learning how to turn followers
00:00:30.000 into money in your bank account. Because
00:00:31.519 the moment you close that first creator
00:00:33.040 partnership, you're sitting on a gold
00:00:34.559 mine. And the only thing standing
00:00:36.000 between you and that multiple five
00:00:37.760 figure shadow operating partnership is
00:00:39.520 what I call the sales skill illusion.
00:00:41.760 Most people hit this point and freeze.
00:00:43.840 But eman, I don't know how to sell. I'm
00:00:45.680 not a salesperson. How am I supposed to
00:00:47.680 convince hundreds of people to buy?
00:00:49.760 That's a trap. So here is what you need
00:00:52.160 to understand. You don't need to sell.
00:00:53.760 You need to monetize. Okay? Selling is a
00:00:56.079 skill. It takes years to learn, years to
00:00:58.239 develop. You need charisma, persuasion
00:01:00.239 techniques, objection handling, closing
00:01:01.920 tactics. Okay? But monetization, that's
00:01:04.159 a formula, a proven sequence you follow
00:01:06.479 step by step that turns attention into
00:01:08.320 money. You are not developing a skill.
00:01:10.240 You are executing a system that does the
00:01:12.400 convincing for you. Think about it like
00:01:14.080 this. And here is the real beauty of
00:01:15.840 monetization. Okay? Remember the math
00:01:17.759 from day one. You can literally get 99%
00:01:20.640 of the audience uh from your creator to
00:01:22.799 completely ignore their content and you
00:01:24.720 will still make serious money. We expect
00:01:27.280 99% of people to scroll past. We expect
00:01:29.600 most people not to buy. Now, let me tell
00:01:32.320 you, there are dozens of ways to launch
00:01:34.079 a digital product for a creator. Okay,
00:01:35.600 inside of Monetize, our clients apply 17
00:01:38.000 different monetization strategies. 17
00:01:40.240 pro proven ways to turn audiences into
00:01:42.560 customers. And there is one we tell
00:01:44.320 every beginner to start with. Why?
00:01:46.159 because because it is the most reliable
00:01:47.920 and easiest to execute and the most
00:01:49.920 beginner-friendly method that there is.
00:01:51.759 And the thing is it's pretty much always
00:01:53.360 works. Okay? When you need something
00:01:55.280 that gets the job done, this is it.
00:01:57.759 Look, you know by now that most people
00:02:00.719 consider me and my team the number one
00:02:02.560 in this digital product uh industry. And
00:02:04.719 honestly, just modesty aside, I believe
00:02:07.439 that we are. Okay? We've generated over
00:02:09.199 100 million in digital product sales. We
00:02:10.959 broke every record on [ __ ] most cash
00:02:13.200 collected in 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days,
00:02:15.920 twice. We've collected over eight
00:02:17.840 figures in a single week using a very
00:02:20.080 specific monetization strategy. And this
00:02:22.160 strategy I'm sharing with you today is
00:02:23.680 built on top of the exact same
00:02:25.040 principles of the strategy we applied.
00:02:27.040 The same three phases that work
00:02:28.800 regardless of whether your creator has
00:02:30.560 5,000 followers or 5 million. The only
00:02:32.800 difference in a format that is 10 times
00:02:34.959 more simple to execute, all executed
00:02:37.280 through Instagram stories. It is called
00:02:38.959 the 14-day Instagram story sequence. And
00:02:41.200 the best thing about this strategy is
00:02:42.959 that you don't need to know how to use
00:02:44.160 social media or even have any personal
00:02:46.480 uh uh personal presence on Instagram to
00:02:48.640 make this work. You just need the system
00:02:50.480 and the ability to mostly copy and paste
00:02:52.319 the steps that I'm about to show you.
00:02:54.400 Now, the real value in what I'm going to
00:02:56.319 show you today is I have figured out the
00:02:58.000 psychology already. I already took care
00:03:00.000 of the difficult part for you and I'm
00:03:01.840 just going to give you the final result.
00:03:03.360 Think about it this way. If you needed
00:03:04.879 to pass a test and I give you the
00:03:06.239 answers, you don't have to know why A or
00:03:08.560 B or C is the answer, okay? You just
00:03:10.640 have to know that for question 12, B is
00:03:12.720 the answer. For question 14, D is the
00:03:14.879 answer. So to follow this methodology,
00:03:17.280 you don't need to be creative. You don't
00:03:18.560 need to figure out what to post. And you
00:03:20.000 don't even need to know how to sell.
00:03:21.840 Okay? You just follow the recipe. Day
00:03:24.159 one, you post this. Day two, you post
00:03:26.080 this. Day three, you do this. It's
00:03:28.239 pretty much like following turnbyturn
00:03:30.000 GPS directions. You don't need to know
00:03:32.080 why you are turning left. You just need
00:03:33.920 to follow the instructions and arrive at
00:03:35.680 your destination. So this way at no
00:03:38.480 point in time do you need to ask
00:03:39.680 yourself what do I need to do now? Okay
00:03:42.080 by the end of today you will walk away
00:03:43.920 with the full playbook ready to execute
00:03:46.080 the moment you close your first creator
00:03:47.680 partnership in any niche. And again I
00:03:50.080 make a point here to remind you that if
00:03:51.840 you are asking yourself well if this is
00:03:53.840 so powerful as you say it is why are you
00:03:55.680 sharing it with me? It's simply because
00:03:57.360 the more you sell the more money I make.
00:03:59.280 Okay that's what's in it for me. Back in
00:04:01.120 episode one I already told you that I'm
00:04:02.560 a co-owner of WAP. Remember, I invested
00:04:04.640 a very large part of my net worth by
00:04:06.799 writing a massive check last year to
00:04:08.799 become a co-owner of [ __ ] the fastest
00:04:10.319 growing digital product platform in the
00:04:11.920 world. The platform where all of these
00:04:13.840 digital products we've talked about get
00:04:15.439 sold and delivered. Now, here's
00:04:16.959 something that most people don't know
00:04:18.000 about WOP's growth. It took our users
00:04:20.399 four years to earn their first billion
00:04:22.320 dollars. Four years to hit that
00:04:23.680 milestone. Do you know how long it took
00:04:25.360 them to earn their second billion? 6
00:04:27.600 months. Let that sink in. Four years for
00:04:30.080 the first billion, 6 months for the
00:04:32.320 second. Our users are seeing are seeing
00:04:34.720 more success than ever before selling
00:04:36.720 digital products, especially the ones
00:04:38.639 who have an audience that they can
00:04:40.080 monetize, which is exactly what our
00:04:41.840 formula today allows you to do. And
00:04:43.759 here's why that matters to you. The more
00:04:45.600 you use this formula, the more you will
00:04:47.440 earn. And if you sell through [ __ ] the
00:04:49.199 more I earn as a as a a result of it.
00:04:51.600 Okay? Our model works off of
00:04:53.040 performance. So the more you guys make,
00:04:54.720 we take a very very very tiny percentage
00:04:56.800 of that. Similar to how private banks
00:04:58.960 work. The richer their clients get, the
00:05:00.639 richer they get as a bank. When you
00:05:02.240 succeed, WAP grows. When [ __ ] grows, I
00:05:04.720 win. Okay? Our incentives are perfectly
00:05:06.800 aligned. I only win when you win. It's
00:05:08.800 that simple. So, the target for today's
00:05:10.400 session is very, very easy. Get you
00:05:12.880 ready to use this formula yourself. And
00:05:14.560 by the way, if you want to find a way to
00:05:16.240 have me answer your questions at any
00:05:18.000 time, 24/7, so that way you are never
00:05:20.720 stuck without knowing which direction to
00:05:22.800 go, we also added a very, very special
00:05:25.680 bonus that will help tremendously in
00:05:27.919 implementing all the stuff that we've
00:05:29.360 covered here today. At first, we weren't
00:05:31.199 actually going to put this here, but
00:05:32.479 because of the results our current users
00:05:34.160 are having with this, I believe that
00:05:35.919 this can be truly helpful beyond any
00:05:37.840 training I could ever give you. But
00:05:39.199 anyways, more on that a bit later. Now,
00:05:41.520 let's dive into the complete 14-day
00:05:43.360 Instagram launch formula. The reason
00:05:45.280 we're going to be using Instagram is
00:05:46.800 that it doesn't require highly produced
00:05:48.639 content to work like YouTube, for
00:05:50.080 example. All right, so it's the easiest
00:05:52.000 way for you to get started. And inside
00:05:53.919 of Instagram, we'll also be using the
00:05:55.680 story feature because it is the easiest
00:05:57.680 content format to create today. the
00:05:59.759 creator is already posting them. It's
00:06:01.759 been proven to be the best way to apply
00:06:03.280 the sequence that I'm about to show you.
00:06:04.960 This 14-day sequence is organized into
00:06:07.120 three specific phases, each building on
00:06:09.199 the previous one. If you miss a phase,
00:06:11.360 you lose a ton of persuasion power. If
00:06:13.759 you follow all three correctly, buying
00:06:16.000 becomes the next logical step for the
00:06:17.759 creator's followers. The first phase is
00:06:19.840 warm-up, days one uh to three. This is
00:06:22.639 where you create a curiosity and gather
00:06:24.639 intelligence without selling anything
00:06:26.400 yet. You're getting people curious.
00:06:28.080 You're making them pay attention and
00:06:29.759 secretly gathering gathering information
00:06:31.680 about their objections, desires, and
00:06:33.520 problems. Think of it like lighting a
00:06:35.680 match. You're creating the first spark.
00:06:37.600 The second phase is value delivery. Days
00:06:40.000 one uh sorry, days four through nine.
00:06:42.240 This is where the real magic happens.
00:06:44.080 Six consecutive days where the creator
00:06:45.759 delivers massive value to their audience
00:06:47.759 before you ask for anything. The creator
00:06:49.600 teaches them uh helps them, shows them
00:06:52.000 what's possible, and by the end of day
00:06:53.680 nine, the creator's audience is not
00:06:55.120 thinking, is this product worth buying?
00:06:56.960 They're thinking when can I buy this?
00:06:58.960 Okay, this is like adding fuel to the
00:07:00.960 fire. The spark becomes a flame. The
00:07:03.280 third phase is the one our clients
00:07:04.800 inside monetize called the money days.
00:07:07.199 Days 10 through 14. This is where we
00:07:09.440 turn all that into anticipation into
00:07:12.000 action. The doors open. The money hits
00:07:14.000 your WP account. And because you did
00:07:15.680 phase one and phase two correctly,
00:07:17.520 people are ready. They've been waiting
00:07:19.199 for this moment. You are not convincing
00:07:20.800 them to buy. You are simply giving them
00:07:22.720 access to what they already want. This
00:07:25.039 is like throwing gasoline on the flame.
00:07:27.039 The fire explodes. Each phase flows into
00:07:29.360 the next. It is a chain reaction. It
00:07:31.599 builds momentum all the way to day 14.
00:07:34.160 Now, here's where this gets super
00:07:36.160 powerful. Remember earlier when I said
00:07:38.160 all of this is like following a recipe
00:07:39.759 to cook some scrambled eggs at home.
00:07:42.160 Well, those ingredients are what I call
00:07:44.160 the psychological buy buttons. And there
00:07:46.720 are 11 of them. 11 psychological buy
00:07:49.120 buttons that control every purchase
00:07:50.639 decision a human being makes. And inside
00:07:52.800 this formula, we've triggered all 11 of
00:07:55.039 them, one at a time. Quick spoiler, buy
00:07:57.599 button number five and buy button number
00:07:59.280 10, those are the most powerful ones in
00:08:01.599 the entire formula. And when you
00:08:03.919 activate those two correctly, sales
00:08:05.759 don't just increase, they explode.
00:08:12.639 Now, look, I'm not going to sugarcoat
00:08:15.360 this, okay? There will be moments when
00:08:17.360 you feel overwhelmed, when your brain
00:08:19.039 starts to hurt a little, when you think,
00:08:20.479 &quot;Wow, this is a lot of information.&quot;
00:08:22.160 That's normal. That's actually a good
00:08:23.440 sign. It means that you are learning
00:08:24.720 something real. But here is what
00:08:26.720 separates uh uh people um
00:08:30.720 sorry guys. Uh one sec. I have just
00:08:33.679 There we go. Uh but here's what
00:08:35.360 separates uh uh people who succeed from
00:08:37.360 those that don't. The ones who succeed
00:08:39.279 push through the discomfort. Okay? They
00:08:40.880 stay until the end. They power through
00:08:42.719 the overwhelm. Because by the end of
00:08:44.560 today, if you stick with me through all
00:08:46.240 of this, you will have a superpower. The
00:08:48.640 super power of turning other people's
00:08:50.560 audiences into money in your bank
00:08:52.560 account. So, here's how I'm going to go
00:08:55.040 ahead and walk you through this. You
00:08:56.640 know, when you go and you start you
00:08:59.040 start driving to a place that you
00:09:00.240 haven't been to before and you check the
00:09:01.839 route on the GPS beforehand, okay? So,
00:09:03.920 that way you know what it looks like.
00:09:05.519 That's basically what I'm going to do
00:09:06.560 with you here today. I'm going to walk
00:09:07.920 you through the route so that way you
00:09:09.200 know exactly what it looks like. Now,
00:09:11.279 you don't need to come up with the route
00:09:12.480 yourself or know, you know, the entire
00:09:14.560 route from the top of your head and when
00:09:16.160 to take each turn. The GPS does that
00:09:18.399 work for you. Just like here, you don't
00:09:20.160 know need to know how to actually
00:09:21.440 activate all these buy buttons yourself.
00:09:23.279 The AI is going to do all that work for
00:09:25.200 you. You simply click generate. So, with
00:09:27.760 that being said, are you committed to
00:09:29.279 spending the next 45 minutes going
00:09:30.959 through this framework? Even if it takes
00:09:32.800 pushing through a bit of pain and
00:09:34.399 overwhelm, because if you are,
00:09:35.920 everything changes for you after today.
00:09:37.920 Type I'm ready. If you are ready to go
00:09:40.080 deep and start learning this system,
00:09:54.399 looks like you guys are excited.
00:09:56.720 Well, let's go ahead and dive into phase
00:09:59.120 one, the warm-up. This is days 1 through
00:10:02.080 three. Imagine this. What do you think
00:10:04.399 makes more money? offering a product to
00:10:06.160 someone straight up or getting them
00:10:08.080 curious and interested first. Think
00:10:09.920 about it for a second. When someone
00:10:11.440 offers you something immediately, what
00:10:13.040 happens? Your guard goes up. Okay? But
00:10:14.959 when someone gets you curious first,
00:10:16.560 gets you engaged. By the time they
00:10:17.920 mention the product, you're already
00:10:19.040 leaning in. Okay? And that's exactly
00:10:20.399 what phase one does. Here's the key
00:10:22.399 question you need to answer during these
00:10:24.000 uh first three days. How do I make them
00:10:26.000 curious about what's coming without
00:10:27.600 having it feel like they're being sold
00:10:28.959 to? And that is the art of the warm-up
00:10:31.120 phase. creating curiosity and gathering
00:10:33.279 intelligence without making it feel like
00:10:35.120 selling. You are lighting the match.
00:10:36.640 You're getting people to pay attention.
00:10:37.920 You are setting the stage for everything
00:10:39.279 that comes next. Now, let's dive into
00:10:41.360 day one. The foundation of everything.
00:10:43.200 And here is what's counterintuitive.
00:10:45.279 Most people think that the first step is
00:10:46.880 to start talking, to teach something, to
00:10:48.560 show value. That's actually wrong. The
00:10:50.320 first step is to start asking questions.
00:10:52.320 Day one is about one thing, the survey.
00:10:54.959 The creator isn't posting educational
00:10:56.640 content yet. They are asking their
00:10:57.920 audience questions. And here is why this
00:10:59.600 is so powerful. There is a psychological
00:11:01.839 phenomenon researchers at Harvard uh
00:11:04.240 call the IKEA effect. I'm sure all you
00:11:07.040 guys know IKEA, right? The furniture
00:11:08.800 company where you buy a box of parts and
00:11:10.640 then you assemble it yourself. Here's
00:11:12.640 what the researchers found. People value
00:11:14.720 furniture they assemble themselves 63%
00:11:17.279 more than identical preassembled
00:11:19.519 furniture. The exact same table, the
00:11:21.760 same quality. Okay? But if you built it,
00:11:24.240 you think it's worth 63% more. Why?
00:11:27.040 Because when you invest effort into
00:11:28.640 something, you value it more. So when
00:11:30.480 someone invests their time answering
00:11:32.079 questions, when they share their
00:11:33.279 struggles and desires, when they put
00:11:35.200 effort into telling you what they want,
00:11:37.440 they become emotionally invested in
00:11:39.440 whatever comes next. And that is what we
00:11:41.600 call the investment buy button. The day
00:11:44.079 one activates it through a simple
00:11:46.320 survey. The creator posts an Instagram
00:11:48.160 story with a Q&amp;A box sticker. So here's
00:11:51.519 basically what this uh sequence looks
00:11:53.040 like. something along the lines of,
00:11:54.880 &quot;I've been thinking about something
00:11:55.920 lately,&quot; or, &quot;I see the same pattern
00:11:57.839 over and over,&quot; or, &quot;Guys hitting the
00:11:59.680 gym five to six times a week, but still
00:12:01.440 frustrated with what they see in the
00:12:02.560 mirror.&quot; They think it's their fault.
00:12:04.000 Okay, I've been working on something, a
00:12:05.680 complete method, but before I finalize
00:12:07.519 it, I need your help. I want to make
00:12:09.200 sure I could cover exactly what you
00:12:10.800 need. Uh, what are your top uh two
00:12:13.360 questions about X or Y? This entire
00:12:16.000 sequence is fully created for you using
00:12:18.079 AI. With this, after day one, you're not
00:12:20.480 guessing anymore. You have the exact
00:12:21.920 words, the exact struggles, the exact
00:12:23.680 desires. If a creator has 30,000
00:12:25.839 followers and just 5% respond, that's
00:12:28.399 1500 people who just invested their time
00:12:30.320 and energy into this. 1500 people who
00:12:32.560 are now committed to seeing what comes
00:12:34.160 next. 1500 people who will feel like the
00:12:36.399 product a product was made specifically
00:12:38.320 for them. Then on day two, we use all of
00:12:41.600 that feedback to create the most
00:12:42.959 powerful feeling in marketing, the
00:12:44.639 feeling that someone truly understands
00:12:46.480 you. You you're going to get a few
00:12:48.000 responses in the Q&amp;A box. Now, here's
00:12:50.560 what most people do with this
00:12:51.680 information. Nothing. Okay? They skim
00:12:53.680 through a few responses and continue
00:12:55.200 with whatever content they had already
00:12:56.959 planned. That's a massive mistake. But
00:12:58.880 not you. Okay? You are smart. So, what
00:13:00.880 are you going to do? You're going to
00:13:02.240 feed all those answers into specialized
00:13:04.320 AI and it's going to create your entire
00:13:06.240 day 2 sequence for you based on the
00:13:08.079 audience's exact pain points. So, that
00:13:10.480 way you you talk exactly on the pain
00:13:13.519 points that they told you about. And
00:13:15.040 then you get something like this. Okay,
00:13:16.880 look guys, you flooded my DMs yesterday.
00:13:18.959 and then you get the exact answers to
00:13:20.880 your audience's questions generated for
00:13:23.040 you. Day two is about showing them that
00:13:25.519 you actually listened. Now, reach uh
00:13:27.519 researchers studying therapy found
00:13:28.959 something very fascinating. They found
00:13:30.240 that the number one predictor of
00:13:31.839 successful treatment isn't a technique.
00:13:34.079 It's whether the patient feels genuinely
00:13:36.079 understood. That is the identific
00:13:39.040 identification by button. You see, after
00:13:41.120 two days, they're no longer random
00:13:42.720 followers. They are individuals who feel
00:13:44.639 heard. Okay. Day three is where you
00:13:46.639 transform those individual connections
00:13:48.320 into something more powerful. The final
00:13:50.399 day of the warm-up phase. You transform
00:13:52.720 scattered individuals into a unified
00:13:55.120 movement. Think about watching a
00:13:56.399 football game alone at home. It's
00:13:57.839 entertaining. You enjoy it. Now, think
00:13:59.760 about watching that same game in a
00:14:01.360 stadium with 50,000 people. Same match,
00:14:03.839 same place, same outcome, but the
00:14:05.440 experience is completely different. The
00:14:06.880 energy is amplified. The emotions are
00:14:08.959 contagious. Every goal feels 10 times
00:14:11.360 more intense. Why? Because you are not
00:14:13.600 just watching anymore. you're a part of
00:14:15.279 something bigger yourself and that is
00:14:17.600 the community buy button. When people
00:14:19.519 feel like they belong to a group that
00:14:21.040 shares their struggles and desires,
00:14:23.920 everything changes, okay? They don't
00:14:25.279 want to miss out on what the group is
00:14:26.880 doing. They don't want to be the only
00:14:28.000 one left behind. The creator shows them
00:14:30.240 that they're not alone. They showcase
00:14:32.079 the massive response from days one and
00:14:33.920 two, screenshots of DMs, engagement
00:14:36.560 numbers, and real comments from real
00:14:38.320 people. Then the creator addresses the
00:14:40.240 most common questions or objections that
00:14:42.240 came up and answers it directly with
00:14:44.480 value with expertise. This builds
00:14:46.320 authority. Finally, they tease what's
00:14:48.560 coming next. Based on the massive
00:14:50.240 response from the last few days, I made
00:14:51.760 a decision. Starting Monday, I'm
00:14:53.680 dedicating an entire week to this. After
00:14:55.440 day three, here is what I've built. Day
00:14:57.600 one, they invested by sharing their
00:14:58.959 problems. Day two, they felt understood
00:15:00.560 because you listen. Day three, they
00:15:02.240 became a part of a tribe waiting for
00:15:03.920 what's next. The warm-up phase is
00:15:06.079 complete. The match is lit. Now let me
00:15:08.480 ask you something. Remember how earlier
00:15:10.240 you were worried about not knowing how
00:15:11.920 to sell? Well, these three days have
00:15:13.920 done all the setup we need. Investment,
00:15:16.000 identification, and community all
00:15:18.000 activated before you ever mention a
00:15:20.399 product. Which means when you do mention
00:15:22.320 it, you are not convincing strangers to
00:15:24.320 buy. You are giving access to a tribe
00:15:26.240 that that's already emotionally invested
00:15:28.240 in the solution. That is the difference
00:15:30.320 between begging people to buy and having
00:15:32.480 them ask you when they get it. That is
00:15:34.720 why phase one is so powerful. Now, phase
00:15:36.959 two is where the creator delivers
00:15:38.800 massive value. Here, we're turning that
00:15:40.880 warm fire into an unstoppable blaze.
00:15:43.680 This is where you romance the market.
00:15:45.680 Think about it like dating, okay? You
00:15:46.959 wouldn't propose on the first uh date,
00:15:49.040 right? You wouldn't take time to build a
00:15:50.880 connection. Uh, sorry, I was going to
00:15:52.959 say you should you would take time to
00:15:54.639 build a connection, show them who you
00:15:56.160 are, as well as demonstrate value. And
00:15:58.720 that's exactly what phase two does. six
00:16:01.360 consecutive days where the creator
00:16:02.639 delivers massive value to their audience
00:16:04.399 before asking for anything in return,
00:16:06.160 teaching them, helping them, showing
00:16:07.600 them what's possible. Now, here is where
00:16:09.680 this usually gets tricky. The creator is
00:16:11.440 the expert in their topic. So, how are
00:16:13.440 you going to create stories for them
00:16:14.560 that deliver massive valuable content if
00:16:16.639 you don't know anything about their
00:16:17.839 topic? Historically, that would require
00:16:19.600 a lot of expertise in marketing and
00:16:21.680 dozens and dozens and dozens of hours of
00:16:23.680 studying the creator's content. But
00:16:25.360 today, you simply let AI analyze all of
00:16:27.759 that content that they've already posted
00:16:29.279 on Instagram and develop the sequences
00:16:31.360 based on that. In one minute of
00:16:33.040 analysis, the AI becomes an expert at
00:16:35.199 any topic. It all starts on day four.
00:16:37.920 This is where the creator shows their
00:16:39.440 audience why they should care. Think
00:16:41.199 about it like going to the doctor. If
00:16:42.639 the doctor walks in and immediately
00:16:44.320 starts listing medications without
00:16:45.920 explaining what's wrong, you'd be
00:16:47.600 confused. But when the doctor first
00:16:49.279 explains what's happening, why it's a
00:16:51.120 problem, and what happens if you don't
00:16:52.800 fix it, now you're listening. Now you're
00:16:54.639 ready for the solution. Day four is the
00:16:56.399 diagnosis before the treatment. Here are
00:16:58.959 the four things the creator does on the
00:17:00.560 fourth day. First, they show you what's
00:17:02.480 possible, painting the picture of the
00:17:04.079 transformation. Second, they explain why
00:17:06.079 the old way doesn't work, calling out
00:17:08.240 the broken system. Third, they share
00:17:10.240 their own story of how they figured this
00:17:12.160 out personally. And fourth, they teach
00:17:14.240 one simple concept that shifts how the
00:17:16.079 audience thinks about the problem.
00:17:17.679 That's it. And you will see this four
00:17:19.439 element in the stories that the
00:17:21.199 specialized AI creates. It opens up with
00:17:23.439 here's what's possible in the next 90
00:17:25.199 days. And then it pivots the old model
00:17:27.039 is broken to then telling their story.
00:17:29.520 Let me tell you why I'm showing you
00:17:30.799 this. And and finally, it finishes by
00:17:33.280 teaching them one simple concept. Now,
00:17:35.120 here's the key concept I want to teach
00:17:36.640 you today. Now, the audience understands
00:17:39.039 why this matters. They see the creator
00:17:40.720 as someone who can guide them. We
00:17:42.400 created authority. But here's the thing
00:17:45.120 about authority. Authority alone can
00:17:47.120 feel distant. It can feel cold. Like a
00:17:48.880 lecturer simply talking down to their
00:17:50.480 students. Day five is where you balance
00:17:52.400 that authority with something that pulls
00:17:54.320 them closer. Vulnerability. Think about
00:17:56.640 the difference between a lecture and a
00:17:58.400 campfire conversation. In a lecture, one
00:18:00.320 person stands up on stage and talks.
00:18:02.400 Everyone else listens from a distance.
00:18:04.320 Around a campfire, though, everyone is
00:18:06.320 on the same level. Stories are shared.
00:18:08.400 Guards come down. Real connections form.
00:18:10.799 Day five is where the creator steps off
00:18:12.799 the stage and sits around the campfire
00:18:14.960 with their audience. That activates the
00:18:16.960 trust button. And remember when I said
00:18:18.480 buy button five and 10 are the most
00:18:20.720 powerful ones. This is five. Trust. When
00:18:23.679 people trust you, everything becomes
00:18:25.200 easier. They listen more. They believe
00:18:26.799 more. They buy more. So how do we create
00:18:28.960 trust in practice? By engaging in public
00:18:31.520 conversations with the audience. And by
00:18:33.360 showing character flaws. Now they don't
00:18:35.760 just respect the creator, they feel
00:18:37.360 connected to them. They understand why
00:18:38.880 this matters. They trust the person
00:18:40.320 teaching them. Okay, that's exactly what
00:18:42.160 day six accomplishes here. You present a
00:18:44.640 clear methodology of what the creator
00:18:46.240 teaches, steps that they can follow, a
00:18:48.400 simple framework of three to five steps,
00:18:50.640 giving their audience some valuable info
00:18:52.559 that they can already implement, but it
00:18:54.640 needs to be actionable and specific,
00:18:56.559 something that they can implement today.
00:18:58.480 When someone gives you genuine value,
00:19:00.400 you feel a natural pull to give
00:19:02.000 something back. That is the reciprocity
00:19:04.080 buy button. And here again, if you don't
00:19:06.000 know how to come up with three the three
00:19:07.520 to fivestep framework for what the
00:19:08.880 creator teaches, it simply doesn't
00:19:10.720 matter. Okay? because the specialized AI
00:19:13.039 comes up up with that entire framework
00:19:15.280 for you. Then the stories look something
00:19:18.080 like this. Can you see how each one is
00:19:20.080 covering a different pillar of the
00:19:21.440 framework that the AI developed? That is
00:19:23.520 the day six done. Okay, let's go ahead
00:19:26.320 and pause for a second and let me have a
00:19:28.480 nice swig of tea.
00:19:35.679 That's a lot of stories. Okay, how's
00:19:38.240 everyone doing so far? Is your head
00:19:39.520 hurting a little bit? Okay, is this a
00:19:41.120 lot to handle? I get it. I told you at
00:19:43.120 the beginning this would be technical.
00:19:44.480 Okay, we just covered six days, six buy
00:19:47.280 buttons, each one building on the
00:19:48.880 previous one. Now, I know you might be
00:19:50.640 thinking, Eman, this is a lot to
00:19:51.840 remember. How am I supposed to keep
00:19:52.880 track of all this? Reme,
00:19:58.640 okay? As long as you have the right
00:20:00.240 specialized AI tools, you just need to
00:20:01.840 click the buttons. Okay? Doing this
00:20:03.120 manually, that's going to require a lot
00:20:04.640 of work and specialized knowledge. But
00:20:06.160 with the right AI, anyone can do this.
00:20:08.400 Remember our GPS analogy. I am walking
00:20:10.960 you through the route so that way you
00:20:12.480 know what it looks like. You don't need
00:20:13.919 to keep track of the entire route or
00:20:15.840 know from the top of your head when to
00:20:17.440 take each turn. The GPS will do all of
00:20:19.520 that work for you. Just like here, you
00:20:21.520 don't need to know how to activate all
00:20:22.720 these buy buttons yourself. The AI will
00:20:24.559 do all of that work for you. So, type
00:20:26.799 I'm here in the chat if you're following
00:20:28.640 along and you are ready to keep going.
00:20:39.039 All right, love it. Let's continue. Day
00:20:42.159 seven. By this point, something powerful
00:20:44.400 is happening. People aren't just
00:20:45.760 consuming, they're implementing. Maybe
00:20:47.760 someone tried this at Day six framework.
00:20:49.520 They got a small win. Someone else saw
00:20:50.960 immediate results. The creators DMs are
00:20:52.640 flooding with excitement. The comments
00:20:54.240 are buzzing. Day seven is where you
00:20:56.000 weaponize that. Think about walking into
00:20:57.760 a restaurant. Okay, two restaurants side
00:20:59.280 by side. You don't know how good the
00:21:00.799 food is in either of them. One is empty,
00:21:02.880 the other one has a line out the door.
00:21:04.559 Which one would you guess had the better
00:21:06.000 food? Okay, probably the one with the
00:21:07.520 line, right? Because if that many people
00:21:09.600 want to eat there, it must be good,
00:21:11.120 right? That is social proof and it's one
00:21:12.880 of the most powerful psychological
00:21:14.240 forces in human decision-making. Here,
00:21:16.400 the creators reshare wins. Okay? Uh the
00:21:18.880 the comments, the DMs, the wins, every
00:21:21.120 everything. Okay? They feature someone
00:21:22.799 who got results in 24 hours from the day
00:21:25.039 six framework. They count out loud. 427
00:21:28.240 people DM me. Thousands of people shared
00:21:30.320 yesterday's story. That is the social
00:21:32.159 proof buy button. Now they're not just
00:21:33.840 interested, they're invested. They've
00:21:35.039 seen others succeed and they don't want
00:21:36.480 to miss out. Then day eight is when you
00:21:38.640 plant the seed for the offer. For doing
00:21:40.880 uh for doing this, you need to walk them
00:21:42.400 through what life actually looks like
00:21:43.840 with the solution. Imagine you wake up
00:21:45.679 tomorrow and you have the complete
00:21:47.120 system. Here is exactly what happens.
00:21:49.200 Step one is handles. Step two connects
00:21:51.200 automatically. Step five, you're already
00:21:52.720 seeing results. Within 30 days, this is
00:21:54.880 your reality. You are making them feel
00:21:56.720 what it's like to own it. This is the
00:21:58.799 story trigger. Days four to seven were
00:22:01.039 about them, their problems, their
00:22:02.640 journey. Day eight is about the
00:22:04.480 solution, what life actually looks like
00:22:06.400 with it. And at the end, we mention the
00:22:08.559 product for the first time. I've been
00:22:10.159 working on something, a complete system
00:22:11.679 that does exactly what I just walked you
00:22:13.440 through. I'm opening access to it soon.
00:22:15.679 Very limited spots. Details tomorrow.
00:22:17.840 That's it. No price, no pressure, just a
00:22:20.159 simple mention so that by day 10 when
00:22:22.240 the cart opens, they're not hearing
00:22:23.840 about the product for the first time.
00:22:25.280 They've been thinking about it for 48
00:22:27.039 hours. They've already imagined owning
00:22:28.480 it. So then you're not introducing a
00:22:30.400 product. You're giving them access to
00:22:31.840 something they already want. Now let me
00:22:34.720 explain the last day of the second
00:22:36.080 phase, day nine. Okay, the final 24
00:22:38.400 hours before money starts hitting your
00:22:40.000 account. This day has two simple jobs.
00:22:42.720 Day one or sorry, job one is to answer
00:22:45.120 questions. By now people have questions,
00:22:46.720 okay? They have doubts. They have
00:22:47.760 concerns that they haven't yet voiced.
00:22:50.000 So
00:22:51.840 we go ahead and make sure the creator
00:22:53.360 posts before doors open tomorrow. I want
00:22:55.919 to make sure that you have zero doubts.
00:22:57.679 Drop every question below. Nothing is
00:22:59.919 off limits. And then actually answer
00:23:02.720 them in stories. Every unanswered
00:23:04.960 question is a sale that you're losing
00:23:06.640 out on tomorrow. Job number two. Make
00:23:08.880 tomorrow unmissable. Tomorrow at 10:00
00:23:11.360 a.m. doors open. Limited spots. Once
00:23:13.760 they're gone, they are gone. Every
00:23:15.520 story, every response ends with tomorrow
00:23:17.360 at 10 a.m. be ready. Think about it like
00:23:19.200 a concert. The band doesn't just show up
00:23:20.960 and play. They announce the date. They
00:23:22.720 remind you. They build excitement. By
00:23:24.080 the time the show starts, you've been
00:23:25.440 counting down for days. That, my friend,
00:23:29.520 is the anticipation buy button. All
00:23:31.840 right, we just covered nine days. We're
00:23:34.559 getting to the last stage of the
00:23:36.000 formula. Now, I don't want you guys to
00:23:38.000 get too caught up in the actual
00:23:39.360 daybyday. The genius part here is how
00:23:41.440 everything connects. Okay, following
00:23:42.880 this 14-day Instagram story sequence is
00:23:45.039 like owning a Ferrari with an automatic
00:23:47.200 transmission. Even if you never driven
00:23:49.039 one before, all you need to do is uh
00:23:51.440 press the gas and break. Okay, the
00:23:53.120 engineering handles everything else. The
00:23:55.200 car has hundreds and hundreds and
00:23:56.799 hundreds of horsepower under the hood.
00:23:58.960 But when you operate it, okay, when you
00:24:00.720 operate a thousand horsepower machine,
00:24:02.640 it operates like a Honda Civic. Okay,
00:24:04.320 that's the exact case here as well. When
00:24:06.559 you use AI to build all this for you, it
00:24:08.960 all flows like one smooth system. I
00:24:10.799 mean, so far we have covered the nine
00:24:12.400 buy buttons. Can you already notice how
00:24:14.240 we are creating massive momentum leading
00:24:16.240 up to the sale here? Can you see why by
00:24:18.080 the time we open the offer, people uh
00:24:19.919 buying becomes the next logical step
00:24:22.320 when you follow this sequence correctly?
00:24:24.320 And during the next 5 days, that is when
00:24:26.720 all this momentum we've built turns into
00:24:28.799 cash. Days 1 to three, you spark the
00:24:31.039 fire. Day four to nine, you poured
00:24:32.880 gasoline on it. Day 10 to 14, you're
00:24:35.120 watching the explosion. And if you
00:24:36.720 haven't gone to this point in a
00:24:37.919 sequence, or sorry, if you have gone to
00:24:39.760 this uh point in the sequence, I should
00:24:41.279 say, congratulations. You already won
00:24:43.600 the battle. So, when the cart opens on
00:24:45.600 day 10, you're not convincing anyone.
00:24:47.760 You are unleashing desire that's been
00:24:49.520 building for 216 hours straight. the
00:24:52.240 first 24 hours, 30 to 40% of total
00:24:55.440 sales. Not because you're pushing, but
00:24:57.120 because they are starving for access.
00:24:58.960 Days uh 11 to 12, you keep the momentum
00:25:01.679 roaring. Day 13 turns up the heat to
00:25:04.000 insane levels. By day 14, that's where
00:25:06.080 40 to 50% of fence sitters make their
00:25:08.480 move in the final hours. By the time the
00:25:10.559 offer closes, you have transformed 9
00:25:12.320 days of desire into money. Real money.
00:25:15.039 That is phase three. Let's get into it.
00:25:17.039 So, from there, we arrive at day 10,
00:25:18.880 money day. This is where we make the
00:25:20.640 offer available to the public. The doors
00:25:22.400 unlock. Now, day uh 10 and uh 11 and 12
00:25:26.080 all activate the same buy button. Fear
00:25:27.919 of missing out. It's that feeling when
00:25:29.600 everyone around you has joined something
00:25:31.039 and you are left behind. And as I said
00:25:33.039 previously, this one and the trust buy
00:25:34.720 button are the most important ones. If
00:25:36.640 you nail this part of the sequence using
00:25:38.320 FOMO correctly, people will almost beg
00:25:40.960 to buy the product. You open with
00:25:43.200 maximum energy. It's here. Doors are
00:25:45.200 open. This is what you've been waiting
00:25:46.480 for. Then we simply explain what's the
00:25:48.960 product, what do they get, how much,
00:25:50.640 what bonuses, what transformation. Okay.
00:25:53.039 Then comes the secret weapon of day 10,
00:25:55.600 early buyer FOMO. Within the first 2 to
00:25:58.000 three hours, people start buying. And
00:25:59.520 you amplify that. Okay. Sara just
00:26:01.279 joined. Michael's in. Jessica grabbed
00:26:02.880 her spot eight minutes ago. Okay, you're
00:26:04.480 not making this up. It's real. People
00:26:06.000 are buying. And when someone sees that,
00:26:07.760 their brain goes into panic mode. Wait,
00:26:09.840 people are already in. What if this
00:26:11.360 fills up? What if I miss out? That's the
00:26:13.679 FOMO buy buttons crushing their
00:26:15.360 hesitation. And here's the beauty of day
00:26:17.279 10. Typically 30 to 40% of your total
00:26:19.760 sales apply uh uh sorry of your total
00:26:22.400 sales happen in these first 24 hours.
00:26:24.640 Not because you're forcing anyone but
00:26:26.320 because they're ready. You basically
00:26:28.240 spent 9 days getting them ready. That's
00:26:30.720 day 10. Okay? And by the end of the day,
00:26:33.120 money is flowing in. Now, at this point,
00:26:35.039 you've captured the hot buyers and the
00:26:36.559 ones who are waiting for this moment.
00:26:39.039 Now, you might be asking, what about
00:26:40.320 everyone else? The ones who need a
00:26:41.679 little bit more nudging. That's really
00:26:43.120 what days 11 and 12 are for. Talking to
00:26:45.600 the almost ready crowd, day 11 has one
00:26:47.760 job. Keep the momentum roaring. The hot
00:26:50.080 buyers already joined on day 10, but
00:26:52.240 there's a second wave sitting on the
00:26:53.919 fence. They're interested. They want it,
00:26:55.360 but they are still thinking. Day 11 is
00:26:57.360 you watching from the sidelines while
00:26:59.039 everyone's already inside. You turn day
00:27:01.039 11 into a social proof avalanche. Now,
00:27:04.559 this is not just a few screenshots. It's
00:27:06.159 an absolute flood. Buyers are sharing
00:27:08.159 their excitement. New members are
00:27:09.600 introducing themselves. And people are
00:27:11.279 already implementing. The community is
00:27:13.440 growing in real time. When fence sitters
00:27:15.520 see this, they realize they're missing
00:27:16.720 out while everyone else is moving
00:27:18.000 forward. When you do something, uh, when
00:27:20.000 you do something, uh, okay, sorry, I was
00:27:23.200 going to say, then you do something uh,
00:27:24.880 day 10 you didn't do, you zoom in on one
00:27:28.080 specific feature. Okay, guys, here's
00:27:30.960 just one thing you get. This single
00:27:32.400 component alone is worth more than the
00:27:33.919 entire price, and you break it down
00:27:35.600 completely what it does, how it works,
00:27:37.279 and the result that it creates. Why?
00:27:39.520 Because fence sitters need a value
00:27:41.520 refresh. They saw the full offer
00:27:43.360 yesterday, but now it's blurry. This
00:27:45.440 makes it sharp again. By the end of day
00:27:47.520 11, fence sitters see three things.
00:27:49.440 Everyone's joining. The value is
00:27:50.720 massive. Time is running out. And that
00:27:52.400 combination converts. Let's see how it
00:27:54.640 would be in practice. Okay. Now, day 12,
00:27:57.840 same FOMO buy uh uh uh sorry, I should
00:28:00.559 say same FOMO buy button. Okay. But this
00:28:02.720 time, we're going ahead and we are
00:28:04.080 demolishing objections. You're removing
00:28:06.159 every excuse they have left. By day 12,
00:28:08.159 the people who haven't bought yet have
00:28:09.520 questions. What ifs. What if this
00:28:11.120 doesn't work for me? What if I don't
00:28:12.559 have time? What if I can't figure it
00:28:13.840 out? Day 12 handles all of this with a
00:28:16.320 comprehensive FAQ. You address every
00:28:18.640 objection directly. Here is what happens
00:28:20.720 if you don't have time. Here's what
00:28:22.080 happens if you're a beginner. When you
00:28:23.760 answer objections head-on, you're not
00:28:25.279 just providing information. You're
00:28:26.480 building trust. You're showing, I'm not
00:28:28.240 hiding anything. I'm not dodging
00:28:29.679 concerns. I want you to make the right
00:28:31.120 decision with full clarity. And here is
00:28:33.120 where FOMO comes back in. While you are
00:28:35.200 answering questions, you're also showing
00:28:36.880 other people uh that other people aren't
00:28:39.200 waiting. Okay? They've already moved
00:28:40.880 past these concerns and joined. Now, a
00:28:42.960 lot of people ask me this question and
00:28:44.720 here is what I told them and most of
00:28:46.159 them are already inside right now. This
00:28:48.399 creates a subtle but powerful message.
00:28:50.240 Your questions are valid, but don't let
00:28:51.919 them paralyze you while everyone else
00:28:53.520 moves forward. By the end of day 12, the
00:28:55.840 fence sitters have no excuses left. Now,
00:28:58.320 we hit day 13 and this is really really
00:29:00.640 where we activate uh urgency at a max
00:29:03.039 potency. Urgency says, &quot;Look, the doors
00:29:05.760 are closing in 24 hours. This
00:29:07.840 opportunity is gone forever.&quot; Days 13
00:29:10.159 and 14 both use urgency. Day 13 is the
00:29:13.360 warning shot. Day 14 is the final
00:29:15.679 countdown. Here is how day 13 works. You
00:29:18.399 make the 24-hour deadline impossible to
00:29:20.559 ignore. Tomorrow, at this exact time,
00:29:22.559 the cart closes. And once it's closed,
00:29:24.720 access is gone. No extensions, no
00:29:26.880 exceptions.
00:29:31.919 And by the way, this isn't a marketing
00:29:33.679 tactic. Like the deadline is actually
00:29:35.200 real. Then you paint what they would
00:29:37.200 lose if they don't act. You're forcing
00:29:39.200 them to confront the cost of inaction.
00:29:40.799 But day 13 isn't just doom and gloom.
00:29:42.640 You're also creating an event
00:29:44.080 atmosphere. Show the momentum, the
00:29:46.240 energy, the final push happening in real
00:29:48.080 time. This combines urgency with a touch
00:29:50.559 of FOMO. Everyone's moving. The clock is
00:29:52.640 ticking. What are you waiting for? Now,
00:29:54.640 we're heading into day 14, the final
00:29:56.399 battle. And this is where the doors slam
00:29:58.000 shut, where 40 to 50% of the fence
00:30:00.080 sitters finally rip off the band-aid and
00:30:01.919 make their move. Day 14 is an allout
00:30:04.880 assault on hesitation. You you wake up
00:30:07.520 swinging. This is it. Final day. Cart
00:30:09.840 closes tonight at midnight. After that,
00:30:11.520 gone. No second chances. This is always
00:30:13.760 the craziest day, by the way. Urgency
00:30:15.279 and FOMO at all-time highs. Then you
00:30:17.679 shift into full countdown mode. 6 hours
00:30:20.000 left, 3 hours left, 1 hour left, 30
00:30:22.159 minutes left, 10 minutes left. When the
00:30:23.840 clock hits zero, you shut it down hard.
00:30:26.080 Cart close. Now the focus is on
00:30:27.760 delivering the best results possible for
00:30:29.840 everyone who joined. Then you flip the
00:30:32.480 energy. Gratitude. Community. Welcome.
00:30:34.799 Thank you to everyone who made the
00:30:36.080 decision. You're inside. The journey
00:30:37.440 starts now. The people who join feel
00:30:39.679 like they made it. The people who didn't
00:30:41.440 feel like the door actually closed in
00:30:42.880 their face. And that is the full 14-day
00:30:45.760 Instagram launch formula executed to
00:30:47.760 perfection. All right, let's go ahead
00:30:50.240 and pause for a second. You just spent
00:30:52.159 the last 30, 45 minutes with me learning
00:30:54.559 something that most people would pay
00:30:55.760 $10,000 for. the exact 14-day sequence,
00:30:58.720 the exact 11 buy buttons, all three
00:31:01.440 phases of the Instagram launch formula,
00:31:03.760 the same psychology me and my team used
00:31:05.679 to collect over eight figures in a
00:31:07.360 single week. And we've done that
00:31:08.640 multiple times already. The same
00:31:10.399 strategy the top players in the industry
00:31:12.240 use to turn followers into serious
00:31:14.480 money. I gave you the complete system
00:31:16.559 for free. Why? Because I don't make
00:31:18.960 money when you learn. Okay? I make money
00:31:20.720 when you execute. When you close a
00:31:22.559 creator, when you run this formula, when
00:31:24.080 you correct collect your first 20, 30,
00:31:25.840 50k, that is when WAP grows, that's when
00:31:28.080 I win. You are literally walking people
00:31:30.159 from, yeah, I follow that person to
00:31:32.000 look, I need to buy it. This is an
00:31:34.000 unfair advantage compared to those who
00:31:35.840 don't know how it works. So everything I
00:31:38.640 just taught you, it's yours. Now, I want
00:31:40.720 to hear from you. After spending all
00:31:42.399 this time learning this with me, do you
00:31:44.399 think that this formula works better
00:31:45.919 than that? Do you see how if you follow
00:31:47.679 these 11 uh steps precisely, all you
00:31:50.320 need is a microcraater to apply this to.
00:31:52.880 Drop I'm sure in the chat if you believe
00:31:55.120 this.
00:32:03.200 All right, great. Well, now, as you've
00:32:05.600 seen, there's a lot to get right with
00:32:07.600 this formula. Okay, and here's the
00:32:09.519 thing. In case you mess anything up
00:32:11.279 along the way, you won't really know up
00:32:12.960 until day 14 when the offer closes and
00:32:15.279 the final numbers come in. If you miss
00:32:17.360 one trigger, well then the entire chain
00:32:19.679 breaks. If you execute day six wrong,
00:32:22.320 day seven doesn't hit as hard. If you
00:32:24.559 forget to seed the offer on day eight,
00:32:26.880 day 10 feels like it came out of
00:32:28.399 nowhere. And that's why it's so
00:32:30.000 important to have the right specialized
00:32:31.760 AI executing this entire sequence for
00:32:34.159 you. This way, not only do you turn 60
00:32:37.039 hours of work into 45 minutes, but most
00:32:39.120 importantly, you execute every trigger
00:32:41.679 correctly from your very first
00:32:43.840 partnership. There are little to no
00:32:46.159 flaws when the AI executes this for you.
00:32:48.080 Okay?
00:32:50.080 You need to understand that the AI knows
00:32:51.760 exactly how to follow all three phases,
00:32:53.919 14 days, and hit all 11 buy buttons
00:32:57.120 precisely. All you need to do is feed it
00:32:59.840 with the creator's Instagram link and
00:33:01.440 hit generate. For example, all of those
00:33:03.760 examples I showed you throughout this
00:33:04.880 entire session, I didn't write any of
00:33:06.720 those. Not a single word. And here's the
00:33:08.159 crazy part. That type of content, just a
00:33:10.159 year ago, I would have p paid a
00:33:11.600 professional copywriter tens of
00:33:12.960 thousands of dollars in order to script
00:33:14.640 it. It would have taken them weeks,
00:33:16.159 maybe months to write all 14 days of
00:33:18.080 content with that level of psychological
00:33:20.399 precision. And today, an AI did it in
00:33:23.360 less than one hour. Okay? So, do you
00:33:25.760 understand how incredible it is that AI
00:33:27.679 has turned one of the hardest and most
00:33:29.200 valuable tasks in the world? Turning
00:33:31.039 followers into money into something that
00:33:33.440 literally anyone can do when they have
00:33:35.440 the right tool. And do you think that if
00:33:37.600 you had access to this exact same tool,
00:33:39.840 you too could follow the steps and
00:33:41.840 create stories exactly like these ones
00:33:43.919 that I've been showing you throughout
00:33:45.519 this presentation? So, with that, it is
00:33:47.760 my great pleasure to introduce to you
00:33:49.519 the latest version of Monetize. Monetize

00:34:03.600 a 14-day story sequence and collecting
00:34:05.919 money. Everything you need all in one
00:34:07.840 place starting with Ghost Writer OS. The
00:34:10.639 exact tool that you are going to use to
00:34:12.239 generate every single sequence we've
00:34:13.839 broken down today with the 14-day
00:34:15.839 Instagram story sequence. Okay. All 14
00:34:18.239 days, all 11 psychological triggers, all
00:34:20.800 this intelligence is pre-programmed into
00:34:22.879 Ghostriter OS for you. So that way, this
00:34:25.520 entire process gets execute per executed
00:34:28.399 perfectly for you using AI. Now, let me
00:34:31.679 show you exactly how Ghost Rider OS
00:34:33.280 works. It is a collection of promptless
00:34:35.280 AI agents that generate all the assets
00:34:37.280 that you need without you having to give
00:34:39.119 it any prompt. But here is what we built
00:34:41.599 specifically for shadow operators. It is
00:34:44.000 a dedicated agent that executes the
00:34:46.159 exact 14-day Instagram story sequence
00:34:48.159 that I just taught you. Not a simplified
00:34:50.320 version, not inspired by it. The exact
00:34:53.040 three phases, the exact 14 days, the
00:34:55.199 exact 11 uh psychological triggers in
00:34:58.000 perfect sequence. Here is the complete
00:35:00.640 process. Step number one, you're going
00:35:02.160 to paste the Instagram's uh the
00:35:03.920 creator's Instagram link and answers two
00:35:06.240 to three very simple questions about
00:35:07.839 them. Then all you need to do is select
00:35:10.000 the agent you want and click generate.
00:35:11.920 As you've seen in practice already, it
00:35:14.000 takes about 60 seconds for each uh each
00:35:16.320 one of the days that you generate this
00:35:18.000 for. You don't need to know any complex
00:35:19.839 details about the creator's methodology
00:35:21.520 or spend weeks researching their
00:35:23.200 audience. Ghostriter does all this for
00:35:25.280 you. Now, here's what makes Ghost Writer
00:35:27.760 OS different from any other AI tool that
00:35:29.599 you've seen. It is not just built for
00:35:31.440 the Instagram launch formula. Okay?
00:35:33.200 Inside Monetize, we apply 17 different
00:35:35.680 monetization strategies with our
00:35:37.440 clients. The 14-day Instagram sequence
00:35:39.520 is just one of them. And Ghost Rider OS
00:35:41.680 has a dedicated AI agent for each
00:35:43.760 strategy. The live uh we've got live
00:35:45.680 webinar funnels, we've got email
00:35:46.960 sequences, we've got VSSL scripts, we've
00:35:48.640 got affiliate campaigns, we have launch
00:35:50.160 events. All 17 methods. You are not just
00:35:52.880 getting one agent. You are getting an
00:35:54.400 entire arsenal of AI agents ready to
00:35:56.480 handle everything you throw at them. So,
00:35:58.960 you choose which strategy you want to
00:36:00.400 use for this creator. For today's
00:36:01.760 example, you're going to select the
00:36:03.200 14-day Instagram launch sequence. Click
00:36:05.119 it. Now, Ghostriter knows exactly which
00:36:07.119 framework to apply. Now, you click
00:36:08.960 generate day one, and Ghostriter creates
00:36:11.200 the complete investment trigger content.
00:36:13.280 Okay? If you generate day two, it
00:36:15.040 creates the ident identification trigger
00:36:17.200 content. Day three, four, five, all the
00:36:19.599 way through to day 14. Each one hitting
00:36:22.000 the exact buy buttons that we mapped out
00:36:23.839 yesterday in the exact order with zero
00:36:26.640 room for error. You are not writing
00:36:28.480 anything. You're not prompting the AI.
00:36:30.320 You're not hoping you got the psychology
00:36:32.560 right. You simply click generate. You
00:36:34.640 copy the result and you send it to the
00:36:36.240 creator. They post on their stories and
00:36:38.160 voila, done. A few clicks and that is
00:36:40.640 all you need to do. Okay? As I said, you
00:36:43.040 do not need to trust yourself. You
00:36:44.560 simply need to trust the software. With
00:36:46.720 the Ghost Rider OS, the 14-day formula
00:36:48.800 isn't something that you need to
00:36:50.079 remember or execute anymore. It is
00:36:52.079 literally pre-programmed into the AI
00:36:54.480 itself. You cannot mess this up even if
00:36:56.960 you tried because you are not the one
00:36:59.119 executing the formula is the AI is. So
00:37:01.760 now if you could execute the 14-day
00:37:04.400 Instagram uh sequence perfectly with
00:37:06.400 ghostriter doing all of the work. Do you
00:37:08.640 now understand that if you find one
00:37:10.640 creator the only thing stop and sorry I
00:37:13.520 should say do you understand that that
00:37:14.800 is the only thing stopping you from
00:37:16.640 having your first successful shadow
00:37:18.160 operating partnership. Think about it.
00:37:20.160 The formula works. The AI executes it
00:37:22.240 flawlessly. The only variable left is do
00:37:24.560 you have a creator to apply it to? Now
00:37:26.400 with ghostriter doing it for you that's
00:37:28.320 real. The only remaining gap would be
00:37:29.920 finding the creator. But even with that,
00:37:31.680 we thought of it. Okay, we knew that
00:37:33.440 this might be something that you would
00:37:34.480 struggle with. So when you join
00:37:35.680 monetize, my team will manually go
00:37:37.440 through the process of identifying
00:37:39.040 creators with high revenue potential and
00:37:41.440 compile a handpicked list of 100 unique
00:37:44.240 creators for you. That is not shared
00:37:46.400 creators that everyone else will get.
00:37:48.079 That is your own unique 100 creators. We
00:37:50.480 are going to do this part for you. Now,
00:37:52.880 why 100? Let me explain the math here.
00:37:55.040 Back when I taught my agency programs,
00:37:57.119 you know, people were charging uh
00:38:00.000 thousands of dollars upfront. Okay? And
00:38:02.160 with that being said, when you were
00:38:03.280 going to business owners and asking them
00:38:04.720 for thousands of dollars up front, on
00:38:06.320 average, it took a 100 contacts to close
00:38:08.800 two. That was the average back then
00:38:11.200 when, as I said, you had to go to
00:38:13.119 business owners and ask them for money
00:38:14.480 up front. Now, imagine this. You are not
00:38:16.880 asking creators to pay you anything
00:38:18.160 upfront. You are offering them the
00:38:19.680 opportunity to make them money. So
00:38:21.200 logically, you shouldn't even need 100,
00:38:23.200 okay? But I want to reduce your risk as
00:38:25.520 much as possible here. So I'm giving you
00:38:26.960 the full 100 list. Now, here's what
00:38:29.359 happens when one of them says yes. You
00:38:31.520 need a product for them to sell. And
00:38:32.880 that's where Synthesize AI 4.0 comes in.
00:38:35.520 That is the most powerful digital
00:38:37.040 product creation engine in the world.
00:38:38.720 Most people mess this part up
00:38:40.000 completely. They pick the wrong topic.
00:38:41.760 They guess what the audience wants. They
00:38:43.359 structure it poorly. Synthesize is like
00:38:45.440 having a product architect who already
00:38:47.280 knows the creator's audience better than
00:38:49.280 they do. You take the creator DNA that
00:38:51.280 Ghostriter already built. You paste into
00:38:53.280 synthesize which then analyzes
00:38:54.800 everything. Then it gives you the top 20
00:38:57.040 product ideas that will actually sell to
00:38:58.960 that specific creator's audience. You
00:39:00.640 pick one, it builds the complete outline
00:39:02.720 and done. The creator simply delivers it
00:39:04.800 live like I'm doing right now with you.
00:39:06.880 No filming, no editing. Just show up,
00:39:09.280 teach, and collect money. Think about
00:39:10.960 this for a second. What would it mean
00:39:12.640 for your results if you never had to
00:39:14.240 guess, will this product idea actually
00:39:15.920 sell? Because AI because AI analyzes the
00:39:18.560 creator's audience, identifies their
00:39:20.400 exact pain points from real comments,
00:39:22.400 and gives you 20 proven product concepts
00:39:24.400 ranked by revenue potential. Last time
00:39:26.480 we opened monetized last year, our users
00:39:28.400 who joined went on to make 15 million in
00:39:30.560 the first 90 days through our ranked uh
00:39:33.359 um monetize mania competition. And by
00:39:35.680 the way, a lot of them actually created
00:39:37.599 their products using Synthesize AI. So,
00:39:40.320 I'm sure you can understand why
00:39:41.520 Synthesize AI is priced at $2,999
00:39:44.720 a year, especially when you consider the
00:39:46.560 huge costs that come with running this
00:39:48.160 sort of high demand task with AI. And I
00:39:51.200 am very happy to let you know that you
00:39:52.880 get it at no extra cost when you enroll
00:39:54.640 monetize today. When you realize that
00:39:56.400 creators have already created all the
00:39:57.839 content and knowledge needed and
00:39:59.440 synthesize organizes it into an easy to
00:40:01.680 consume actionable format that their
00:40:03.440 audience will pay for, doesn't this
00:40:05.200 remove the single biggest mental barrier
00:40:07.200 stopping people from becoming shadow
00:40:08.720 operators? So now you have the product.
00:40:11.760 Congratulations. Next, you need to
00:40:13.680 launch it. Now, as I said, the 14-day
00:40:15.680 Instagram story sequence is just one of
00:40:18.079 17 monetization methods we have. And
00:40:20.240 that's exactly what I will share with
00:40:21.520 you inside the shadow operating
00:40:23.040 playbook. Think of it like this.
00:40:24.960 Ghostriter is your calculator. The
00:40:26.720 shadow operating playbook is your math
00:40:28.320 textbook. One does the work for you, and
00:40:30.079 the other one teaches you exactly when
00:40:31.680 to use it and why. It walks you through
00:40:33.760 everything step by step. how to find
00:40:35.440 creators, how to message them, what to
00:40:36.960 say when they say yes, how to onboard
00:40:38.640 them, how to apply all 17 different
00:40:40.320 monetization strategies. You will
00:40:42.160 literally watch over my shoulder as I
00:40:43.920 build actual digital products, see every
00:40:45.599 mistake I avoid, every shortcut I take,
00:40:47.680 every breakthrough moment when it
00:40:49.200 separates winners from everyone else.
00:40:50.960 Think of it as having me as your own
00:40:52.640 personal trainer. But instead of
00:40:53.760 building muscle, we're bu we're building
00:40:55.599 your financial freedom. So can you see
00:40:57.920 how the playbook gives you the strategic
00:40:59.839 understanding of when and why to use
00:41:01.839 each tool while Ghost Rare and
00:41:03.520 Synthesize actually execute the entire
00:41:05.839 work for you? Meaning you have both the
00:41:07.760 knowledge and the automation working
00:41:09.920 together. And finally, where does this
00:41:12.800 entire operation actually live? Floy,
00:41:14.960 this is your mission control center.
00:41:16.400 Okay, your 100 creators, we are going to
00:41:18.160 manually load them in within your own
00:41:19.680 CRM. So that way uh you're going to have
00:41:21.760 it and you're going to manage these
00:41:23.119 creators and all your outreach efforts
00:41:24.880 there. Now, we didn't just give you the
00:41:26.720 software. We gave you the entire
00:41:28.000 operating system. Don't you understand
00:41:29.839 how having your own CRM preloaded with a
00:41:32.000 100 creators makes the process of
00:41:34.000 closing your first shadow operating
00:41:35.359 partnership as easy as it could humanly
00:41:37.200 be? Now, you might be thinking, &quot;Okay,
00:41:38.720 man. This is everything I need.&quot; Okay?
00:41:40.480 And honestly, it is. But let me ask you
00:41:43.680 something. What's the only possible way
00:41:45.920 you could still fail with all of this?
00:41:47.440 You get stuck. All right? You have
00:41:52.400 questions. Okay? You're not sure how to
00:41:55.839 handle a specific situation with your
00:41:57.280 creator and you have no one to ask.
00:42:00.480 Well, what if you needed to get an
00:42:02.079 answer directly from me? Normally, the
00:42:05.839 only way you can get one-on-one access
00:42:07.200 to me is by becoming an enterprise
00:42:09.280 client at our consulting firm. We have
00:42:11.599 hundreds of clients paying $25,000 for
00:42:14.000 this level of access. But here is what
00:42:16.240 we built specifically for our monetized
00:42:18.640 clients. And this is only available
00:42:20.800 until the end of today. Okay? This is a
00:42:23.119 webinar exclusive bonus. It's called Ask
00:42:25.920 Eman. Think of it as your personal
00:42:28.079 shadow advisor.
00:42:30.640 We have trained Ask Eman on over 3,000
00:42:33.520 hours of my content. Hundreds of videos,
00:42:36.000 internal uh workshops, uh internal
00:42:38.240 client calls, internal team meetings,
00:42:40.319 consulting calls with my $25,000
00:42:42.319 clients. So now, anytime you're stuck,
00:42:44.720 you just ask me. If you don't know how
00:42:46.400 to apply something, ask Eman. If you got
00:42:48.240 stuck and don't know what to do next,
00:42:49.520 ask Eman. If you're not sure the best
00:42:51.119 way to handle a creator's objection,
00:42:52.720 just ask you, man. It answers exactly
00:42:54.640 the way that I would with the same
00:42:56.319 reasoning, the same strategies, and the
00:42:58.560 exact same frameworks. And here's the
00:43:01.040 crazy part. One of our enterprise
00:43:02.800 clients who paid us 25 uh sorry,
00:43:04.640 $250,000 to work with us one-on-one,
00:43:07.599 well, he sent me a question on WhatsApp
00:43:09.440 the other day, but before I could
00:43:11.599 respond, because I was actually in New
00:43:12.800 York, uh checking in on our uh fifth
00:43:14.640 floor expansion for our WP headquarters.
00:43:17.200 So, I was there and as I said, this is a
00:43:19.760 wasn't an active client at the time, but
00:43:22.160 he was a client that as said paid
00:43:23.599 $250,000 to work with myself and my team
00:43:26.319 on a one-to-one basis over the space of
00:43:27.839 a few months and basically train his
00:43:29.200 team. So, this is like the top top uh
00:43:31.520 level, you know, some of the most
00:43:32.480 advanced questions uh that you could
00:43:34.240 get. And before I had time to respond,
00:43:36.640 he basically messaged me this. He goes,
00:43:38.079 &quot;Uh, this is what uh Ask Eman replied.
00:43:40.160 Pretty good NGL.&quot; Cuz he sent me a long
00:43:41.920 long question. And instead, he just
00:43:43.119 asked Eman. Okay? He sent me the
00:43:44.880 screenshot and I literally thought to
00:43:46.000 myself, this is exactly what I would
00:43:47.280 have said. That is how accurate this
00:43:48.960 thing is. Okay, so even if everything
00:43:50.720 goes sideways, even if you hit a
00:43:52.319 situation that you've never seen before,
00:43:53.839 even if you're completely stuck, you
00:43:55.520 have me available 24/7 as your mentor
00:43:58.640 and as your coach, this is, as I said,
00:44:00.800 literally having me as your personal
00:44:02.240 shadow advisor. So, let me ask you this.
00:44:04.160 If the only way you could fail is by
00:44:06.319 getting stuck without knowing what to do
00:44:07.760 next. And now you have an AI trained on
00:44:10.400 literally 3,000 hours of my knowledge
00:44:12.560 that answers your questions 24/7.
00:44:15.280 Doesn't that mean that failure becomes
00:44:16.800 almost impossible? When you think about
00:44:18.640 it, what's actually more valuable?
00:44:20.319 Having all the tools and the systems or
00:44:22.319 having someone who can guide you through
00:44:23.760 every decision, every roadblock, every I
00:44:25.839 don't know what to do here moment. And
00:44:27.440 you are getting both. But here's the
00:44:29.599 thing. Asky Man is only available if you
00:44:32.000 join monetize before the end of today at
00:44:34.560 11:59 p.m. EST. This bonus disappears.
00:44:37.920 Okay? It will not be available tomorrow.
00:44:39.839 It won't be available next week. Okay?
00:44:41.599 It will only be available uh actually, I
00:44:43.680 should say, until the end of today's
00:44:45.119 live. All right? So, I think uh this
00:44:47.839 time we ended up going a little longer.
00:44:49.520 So yeah, once we uh uh end off today's
00:44:52.160 live um uh until the rest of uh the day
00:44:55.760 at 11 p.m. EST, that is when it will uh
00:44:59.040 it will go away. Okay, so this is really
00:45:00.800 your only shot at having me as your
00:45:02.400 shadow adviser and you get it for free
00:45:04.240 inside monetize. After today, if you
00:45:06.480 want this level of access to my
00:45:07.839 knowledge, you're going to need to
00:45:08.720 become one of our enterprise clients.
00:45:10.079 Again, that starts at $25,000 and that's
00:45:12.800 even if we have availability at that
00:45:14.640 time. Now, if you thought we were done,
00:45:16.960 beyond Ask Eman, which is today's only
00:45:18.960 bonus, we also have two additional
00:45:20.480 bonuses inside monetize. First is your
00:45:22.960 consulting.com certificate. This
00:45:25.040 officially recognizes you as a
00:45:26.640 consultant.com qualified operator. This
00:45:28.800 way, when you're reaching out to
00:45:30.000 creators, you can tell them that you you
00:45:31.599 are certified by the number one
00:45:33.200 consulting firm in the digital product
00:45:34.960 space. Instant authority, instant
00:45:36.480 credibility. Can you see how having an
00:45:38.560 official certification eliminates the
00:45:40.480 who are you and why should I trust you
00:45:42.079 objection before it even comes up?
00:45:44.160 Finally, I'm going to light a fire under
00:45:46.079 your ass with a even bigger reason to
00:45:48.079 take action and become a shadow
00:45:49.359 operator. I'm giving you a golden ticket
00:45:52.319 to the third edition of our monetized
00:45:54.079 mania competition. So, let me tell you
00:45:56.079 how this works.
00:46:02.560 Starting next Tuesday, we are kicking
00:46:04.240 off a 90-day competition between
00:46:06.319 everyone who joins monetize. 90 days
00:46:08.160 from now, the five individuals who
00:46:09.920 finish at the top will get a
00:46:11.440 complimentary seat at the consulting.com
00:46:13.520 quantum mastermind. That is our
00:46:15.280 exclusive mastermind experience that
00:46:16.800 clients pay $25,000 to join. Now, for
00:46:19.119 our last mastermind event, we uh
00:46:21.119 literally rented out one of the best
00:46:22.880 vineyards in the world for our
00:46:24.720 consultant.com clients. We spent
00:46:26.240 hundreds and thousands of dollars to
00:46:27.680 book out the entire place. We spent
00:46:29.119 three days there masterminding about
00:46:30.560 online business. So, if you finish at
00:46:32.720 the top of the Monetized Mania
00:46:33.920 leaderboard, you're going to get to sit
00:46:35.359 and spend three days together behind
00:46:36.880 closed doors in the same room as people
00:46:38.480 making 100, 200, even $500,000 a month
00:46:41.119 from their shadow operating business.
00:46:42.720 You're going to get to personally
00:46:43.680 network with them and learn their
00:46:44.880 strategies. How insane an opportunity
00:46:46.960 would it be for you to sit in the same
00:46:48.400 room as the top shadow operators in the
00:46:50.240 world today? That is the opportunity you
00:46:52.079 get when you join Monetize. Now, let's
00:46:54.880 go ahead and talk about what all this is
00:46:56.400 worth. Ghost Rider OS. Just in the last
00:46:58.800 six months alone, I have paid this
00:47:00.160 company over $530,000 in licensing fees.
00:47:03.520 Here are the bank wires of each payment
00:47:05.520 to prove it. Okay, so I'm paying almost
00:47:07.920 $100,000 a month to make this available
00:47:10.160 to you inside Monetize. Synthesize AI
00:47:12.800 4.0 is listed at 200 uh sorry, $2,999
00:47:16.480 per year standalone. Plus, I've gone
00:47:18.240 ahead and preloaded it with an extra
00:47:20.640 $250,000 in AI credits for you to use.
00:47:24.000 You also get a yearly plan of Floy. Now,
00:47:26.720 normally this is $1,68 a year, but
00:47:29.280 you're going to get that entirely for
00:47:30.560 free. The Shadow Operating Playbook.
00:47:32.400 I've historically sold similar programs
00:47:34.240 for $1,495,
00:47:36.480 just the program standalone, plus the
00:47:38.560 100 prevetted creators, which takes
00:47:40.480 weeks of manual work from my team.
00:47:42.480 You're going to get the monetized mania
00:47:43.920 tickets. That's $25,000 a pop normally.
00:47:46.240 So, that's $125,000 in bonuses just from
00:47:49.040 that. And you're going to get Ask Eman.
00:47:51.040 The only other way to ask me questions
00:47:52.960 directly is to become a $25,000
00:47:55.760 enterprise client of ours. So, just
00:47:58.720 based on how much it's cost me to put
00:48:00.240 this entire thing together, we're
00:48:01.680 talking about hundreds of thousands of
00:48:03.040 dollars, but you are not paying anywhere
00:48:04.720 near that for how much this has cost me.
00:48:06.960 Now, I'm sure with all that being said,
00:48:08.880 you can understand how it would be
00:48:10.720 totally easy for me to charge $10,000
00:48:12.640 for this and it would still be worth it.
00:48:14.319 At 5,000, it's an insane deal, which is
00:48:16.640 why it's an absolute no-brainer for you
00:48:18.480 to sign up right now at a special price
00:48:20.400 of $1,995.
00:48:22.400 And yes, financing is available if you
00:48:24.880 need it. In fact, we have the most
00:48:26.400 flexible financing you'll find anywhere.
00:48:28.160 Now, the only question is, are you ready
00:48:30.319 to take advantage of this opportunity
00:48:31.760 and become a shadow operator? If so,
00:48:34.319 here is what happens next. In just a
00:48:35.920 moment, I'm going to drop a link for you
00:48:37.280 to join in the comments. When I drop
00:48:38.720 that link, you have a decision to make.
00:48:40.400 You can either take everything we've
00:48:42.240 talked about today and file it away as
00:48:44.319 interesting information and just
00:48:46.319 basically go back to what you've always
00:48:47.680 done or you can take action right now
00:48:50.000 and take the first step to become a
00:48:51.440 shadow operator in the next 90 days. The
00:48:53.359 choice is yours. But remember this exact
00:48:55.280 offer with all these bonuses will never
00:48:57.119 be available again. So, if you are ready
00:48:58.800 to finally build an online income using
00:49:00.559 AI without requiring you to put your
00:49:02.160 face out there or have any previous
00:49:03.760 experience, then click the link that I'm
00:49:05.200 dropping in live chat in three, two,
00:49:08.640 one. Now, in case you can't click it,
00:49:11.520 just go to join eman and it will take
00:49:12.960 you to the same page. You're going to be
00:49:14.240 direct redirected to a secure checkout
00:49:16.160 page. Choose the payment option that
00:49:17.920 makes the most sense to you and let's go
00:49:19.599 ahead and start building and working on
00:49:21.200 closing your one partnership today. Now,
00:49:24.880 on top of all this, I want to offer you
00:49:26.480 an insane guarantee to back this up.
00:49:28.640 This is a better than money back
00:49:30.400 guarantee. It is a work with you until
00:49:32.240 you win guarantee. Here is how it works.
00:49:34.240 You don't just get access to the tools
00:49:35.760 in the system. You get me and my team
00:49:37.599 committed to working with you until you
00:49:39.599 close your first creator partnership and
00:49:41.359 make at least a 10x return on your
00:49:42.800 investment. Not until you feel ready,
00:49:44.079 not until you understand everything, but
00:49:45.520 until you actually land a creator and
00:49:47.200 have a partnership that pays you and
00:49:48.559 pays you well. If it takes 3 months,
00:49:50.559 we're there. If it takes six months,
00:49:51.760 we're there. If it takes a year, we're
00:49:53.359 still there. Throughout this entire
00:49:54.720 time, we keep giving you updates, new
00:49:56.319 training, new support, new strategies,
00:49:57.920 more done for you. Exactly like we have
00:49:59.920 already done for our current users three
00:50:02.240 times last year. I just gave you my
00:50:04.000 word. Now, let me show you my action.
00:50:06.079 Recently, we discovered a new method to
00:50:07.760 get digital product sales insanely fast.
00:50:09.760 Now, we could have took that and sold it
00:50:11.280 for $2,000 extra. And I know that many
00:50:13.520 people would have taken that. But
00:50:14.800 instead, I told you I'm never going to
00:50:16.559 charge you for updates until you
00:50:17.760 succeed. So, what did I do instead? I
00:50:19.280 hosted an entire four-week workshop
00:50:21.040 within the Monetiz community breaking
00:50:22.559 down this method during a [ __ ] ton of
00:50:24.079 live sessions completely free. By the
00:50:26.079 way, you can even watch the recordings
00:50:27.359 in the community when you join. Every
00:50:29.359 single user who joined monetize in
00:50:31.839 January got the alpha version of
00:50:33.280 Synthesize for 995. Since then, the
00:50:35.520 software has undergone two complete
00:50:37.440 overhauls. We've added dozens of new
00:50:39.200 features that weren't ever promised. The
00:50:40.559 2.0 version, the 3.0 version, which
00:50:42.240 already made an entirely new software,
00:50:44.000 and now the 4.0 version with all the
00:50:45.920 shadow operating modules. And every
00:50:47.599 single one of our original customers got
00:50:49.520 the 2.0, the 3.0, and the 4.0 version
00:50:52.000 entirely for free. The clients were in
00:50:54.079 awe when they got access to it for free
00:50:55.680 because this is this is the exact same
00:50:57.200 version that, as I said, is listed for
00:50:59.040 $2,999.
00:51:00.720 They got all this and no extra charge.
00:51:03.119 Ghostriter, I have to pay almost
00:51:04.880 $100,000 per month to license it. I pay
00:51:07.280 per seat. The original users of
00:51:09.040 Monetized, they weren't promised this. I
00:51:10.720 still gave access to all them for free,
00:51:12.800 and those were thousands of seats I had
00:51:14.400 to pay for. Then I created the shadow
00:51:16.000 operating playbook. Was that included in
00:51:17.839 the original package we launched? No. I
00:51:19.839 could have easily sold it for an extra
00:51:21.440 $1,500 like I've done tens of thousands
00:51:23.359 of times with my previous program. So
00:51:24.800 what did I do instead? I gave it to all
00:51:26.480 the monetized users for free. Then I
00:51:28.559 acquired a company called Consult.com.
00:51:30.559 That is their previous office in
00:51:31.920 Manhattan. At the time I acquired it,
00:51:33.760 their flagship program sold for almost
00:51:35.920 $2,000 and over 20,000 customers had
00:51:38.480 paid them that amount for this program.
00:51:40.319 I paid $1.7 million in a clean wire to
00:51:43.440 acquire this. Okay. Now, before I
00:51:45.280 acquired it, they'd made almost $80
00:51:47.119 million in sales. Do you know how many
00:51:48.800 times I sold this $2,000 program after
00:51:50.800 the acquisition? Zero. Instead, I gave
00:51:53.040 it to all my customers for free. Just a
00:51:55.440 few weeks ago, a few of my pro users had
00:51:57.520 a 90-day consulting package that was
00:51:59.599 coming to an end. What did I do? I
00:52:01.440 renewed the package for every single one
00:52:03.119 of them that still hadn't 10x their
00:52:04.720 investment for another 90 days just to
00:52:06.720 make sure that they were taken care of.
00:52:08.079 And these are just a few of the recent
00:52:09.440 examples. So, when I say we work with
00:52:11.040 you until you win, I mean it. And as I
00:52:13.359 always say, what you need is the ability
00:52:15.920 to create money on demand. The skill of
00:52:17.920 turning a creator's audiences into
00:52:19.599 dollars uh into dollars in your bank
00:52:21.920 account. Because once you have that
00:52:23.040 skill, once you've closed that first
00:52:24.640 partnership, all of your problems
00:52:26.079 disappear. You're not worried about
00:52:27.520 money anymore. Okay? You're not stuck in
00:52:28.960 the 9-5 grind if you don't want to. You
00:52:31.119 get to make decisions from a place of
00:52:32.480 abundance, not necessity. And that's
00:52:34.319 worth infinitely more than the $1,995
00:52:37.760 investment. That's why the guarantee,
00:52:39.680 okay, is what it is. The guarantee is
00:52:41.920 work with you until it does. Period.
00:52:44.400 Okay? It's simple. You have to close
00:52:45.760 your first creative partnership and 10x
00:52:47.440 your investment or we will keep working
00:52:48.960 with you until you do. Because with this
00:52:50.400 business, you only need to get this
00:52:51.760 right once. One partnership can
00:52:53.599 completely change your entire life
00:52:54.880 situation. That is what I call your
00:52:56.800 turning point. The moment your online
00:52:58.319 income surpasses your main income stream
00:53:00.400 and covers all of your living expenses.
00:53:02.400 No boss tells you what to do. No one
00:53:04.559 controls your schedule. No one puts a
00:53:06.319 price on your time. That is the moment
00:53:08.000 you reclaim ownership of your life. And
00:53:09.920 the last time I opened monetize, I
00:53:11.520 helped thousands of people achieve that.
00:53:13.200 Now, I'm giving you the same
00:53:14.480 opportunity. So, as I said, you really
00:53:15.920 have two options here. Either you
00:53:17.119 succeed and close your first creator
00:53:18.640 partnership, or we keep working with you
00:53:20.319 until you do. The only way for you to
00:53:22.000 lose is to not try. Plus, your
00:53:23.839 investment is protected with a full
00:53:25.359 7-day uh uh uh refund policy. If for any
00:53:28.480 reason you don't like what you get
00:53:29.359 inside Monetize, email
00:53:30.720 support@monetize.com within 7 days. 100%
00:53:34.160 refund, no questions asked. Process
00:53:35.599 within 48 hours. I'm taking all the risk
00:53:37.839 here. You literally have none. So, here
00:53:39.839 is exactly what happens. After you click
00:53:41.359 the link in the comments, you're going
00:53:42.640 to land on a secure checkout page. It
00:53:44.319 takes 2 minutes to complete. You're
00:53:45.520 going to choose your payment option.
00:53:46.720 Financing is available if you need it.
00:53:48.480 The second you complete the checkout,
00:53:49.839 you get instant access. The welcome
00:53:51.680 email hits your inbox immediately with
00:53:53.200 your login credentials. You log into

00:53:58.240 operating playbook. Your 100 prevetted
00:53:59.839 creators and flows asky man. All of it.
00:54:01.920 Day one, start the playbook. Explore the
00:54:03.839 tool. Week one, build your outreach to
00:54:06.000 100 creators. Generate your first

00:54:09.119 Week 2 to 4, close your first creator.

00:54:12.480 Generate the 14-day sequence. Day 30 to
00:54:14.720 60, launch, execute the formula, and
00:54:16.880 watch sales come in. That is the path
00:54:18.559 from checkout to your first creator
00:54:20.079 partnership generating revenue. 30 to 60
00:54:22.480 days is possible if you execute. The
00:54:24.559 link is in the comments right now. I've
00:54:26.240 given you the formula. I've given you
00:54:27.440 the tools. I've given you the creators.
00:54:28.800 The only question left is what are you
00:54:30.960 going to do with it? So, let me go ahead
00:54:33.119 and remind you that Ask Eman disappears
00:54:35.119 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time today. Okay?
00:54:38.480 11:59 p.m. Eastern time today. Ask Eman
00:54:40.960 will disappear as a bonus. It will be
00:54:42.880 gone. The only other way to get this
00:54:44.640 level of access to everything I know is
00:54:46.559 by becoming an enterprise client, which
00:54:48.240 starts at $25,000. So, by giving away
00:54:50.559 the software, do you understand how you
00:54:52.960 basically have the exact same outcome
00:54:54.400 for free? Okay, this only makes sense as
00:54:56.559 a limited time bonus. And now I want to
00:54:59.119 bring on someone who's been watching
00:55:00.480 this entire session with me. Someone
00:55:01.760 who's been taking notes on every
00:55:03.040 question you guys have been asking in
00:55:04.319 the chat and has also been with us
00:55:06.000 during the previous days. I want to
00:55:07.520 bring on Jason Fladlin. Now Jason has
00:55:09.359 generated over hund00 million in sales
00:55:11.280 for other people's products as a shadow
00:55:13.359 operator. So until this live ends, Jason
00:55:16.160 will be with us answering each one of
00:55:18.480 your questions, clarifying everything
00:55:21.280 that's confusing, breaking down the
00:55:22.559 parts that feel complicated, and making
00:55:24.079 sure you walk away from today with zero
00:55:26.079 confusion about how this actually works.
00:55:27.920 So with that being said, let's welcome
00:55:29.760 Jason Fladdlin.
